Prior to being in ICS, I was a Research Scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. While at PARC, I am most known as a founder of the group that developed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and started aspectj.org. My interests have expanded considerably since then. To find out about my current projects and students, follow the links on the left or visit the mondego pages.              I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from  Instituto Superior T¨¦cnico, in Lisbon, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Northeastern University, in Boston. I also studied piano and voice, and have sung in choirs such as the San Francisco Symphony Chorus (1999-2002) and the Gulbenkian Choir (1989-1992).   I received a National Science Foundation's CAREER Award, 2004-2009.  I'm  Erdos number 3 (Erdos -> Specker -> Lieberherr -> me).

Homework/lab projects (1/3) + Quizzes (1/3) + Exam (1/3)  	Pedagogy:         - Lectures cover the material in the reading materials by placing it in         context, giving examples, and engaging in Q&As.          - Discussionss focus on implementation issues. They support the         discussion of homework projects.         - Homework projects are hands-on vehicles for learning the material.         Collaboration and knowledge exchange are encouraged in the projects, but mindless         copy of solutions (aka cheating) is not allowed.         - The quizzes are checkpoints to evaluate each student's knowledge of         the material. The quizzes cover implementation issues of the homeworks, principles         discussed in the lectures and facts stated in the reading         materials.         - The final exam challenges the student's grasp of "the big picture."         Rather than focusing on small portions of the material, it mixes         everything.

Robbins,         SIGIR, 2003          Commentary: "This paper addresses an increasingly important problem         - how to search and manage personal collections of electronic         information. ... it addresses an important user-centered problem.         ...this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system         useful. ..., the paper includes large scale, user-oriented testing that         demonstrates the efficacy of the system. ..., the evaluation uses both         quantitative and qualitative data to make its case. I think this paper         is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people         manage their files for a decade. Moreover, it is well-written and can         serve as a good model for developers doing system design and         evaluation, and for students learning about IR systems and         evaluation."  	4. "Simple,         Proven Approaches to Text Retrieval" by Robertson and Jones           Commentary: "This paper provides a brief but well informed and         technically accurate overview of the state of the art in text         retrieval, at least up to 1997. It introduces the ideas of terms and         matching, term weighting strategies, relevance weighting, a little on         data structures and the evidence for their effectiveness. In my view it         does an exemplary job of introducing the terminology of IR and the main         issues in text retrieval for a numerate and technically well informed         audience. It also has a very well chosen list of references."

"The         Web As a Graph" by R. Kumar, P Raghavan, S. Rajagopalan, D.         Sivakumar, A. Tomkins, E. Upfal, PODS 2000          Abstract: "The pages and hyperlinks of the World-Wide Web may be         viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph. This graph has about a         billion nodes today, several billion links, and appears to grow         exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical,         sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph.         We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph,         addressing problems from Web search, automatic community discovery, and         classification. We then recall a number of measurements and properties         of the Web graph. Noting that traditional random graph models do not         explain these observations, we propose a new family of random graph         models."

Page (this link is to the long version, the short version         was publishied in WWW1998)          Commentary: "This paper (and the work it reports) has had more         impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area. A major         contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search         results are greatly more valued by searchers than others. By reflecting         this in their evaluation procedures, Brin and Page were able to see the         true value of web-specific methods like anchor text. The paper presents         a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which         now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over         billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at         the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection,         high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and         context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers         had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency,         scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper         showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer         attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this         must be the first port of call."

"Indexing         by latent semantic analysis" by (Deerwester, Dumais, et.al)          Commentary: " IR, as a field, hasn't directly considered the issue         of semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the few         that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis (LSA)         applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a growing         ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by the term         "semantic space". LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility         with human information processing across a variety of information         processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way         which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads.         Finally, the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to         have increased markedly in recent years. The above paper has also made         an impact outside our field. For example, recent work on latent         semantic kernels (machine learning) draws heavily on LSI.

Although there are a variety of such calculators available, the majority share the same form of user interaction. We analyze how, with this mode of interaction, most calculators focus on the environmental impact of individual actions without drawing attention to the broader impacts of those actions on the surrounding community and world. To address these problems, we present the Better Carbon calculator, which uses collaborative filtering and location- based calculation to provide an individual footprint estimate while simultaneously affecting and improving the estimates for other people in a user's community. This method also allows Better Carbon to be more extendable, as additional forms of impact can be considered without requiring additional user effort. Better Carbon can thus provide quicker and easier footprint estimates, and help the process of calculating a carbon footprint create stronger linkages within the communities of its users.  Euphony People have a myriad of devices near them all the time - their laptop, phone, desktop computer, etc. However, when using any one of the devices the other devices are usually unused and not helpful. Euphony aims to establish a system to make devices near you helpful based on what you are doing.  Peer-to-Peer Sensor Sharing As mobile devices become more ubiquitous, we are likely to see the spread of computational systems for urban sensing and other forms of context identification. However, there has not yet been sufficient consideration of how to reduce the potential environmental impacts of such systems. In an attempt to combat these foreseen impacts, we apply the concept of sustainable sharing to urban sensing, envisioning a distributed mode of interaction in which users can automatically share locally sensed information with other collocated devices. We present simulations and survey findings that demonstrate the viability of such a peer-to-peer interaction, as well as indicate key challenges for deployment such as privacy concerns. Due to energy requirements, sensor sharing using current technology may not yet make urban sensing more sustainable. However, our findings suggest that sharing capabilities and functionality can eventually be a viable interaction mode for environmentally sustainable urban sensing.

OpenSimulator   OpenSimulator is an open   source application server and a framework for developing 3D virtual   environments a-la Second Life. I became involved with this project   back in 2008 during my first sabbatical; I was looking for an   opportunity to reconnect with software development in the real   world. I haven't stopped since then.

Those who break my trust at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university.     Students with Disability  Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

Study of concepts, representations, techniques, and case studies  				in structuring software systems, with an emphasis on design considerations. Topics include static and dynamic  				system structure, data models, abstractions, naming, protocols and application programmer interfaces. 				 				Structure 				The class will be discussion-oriented. Papers must have been read beforehand, and discussion will be  				seeded by short presentations summarizing the key points of each paper. Presentations will be rotated  				among those in the class. 				 				Case Study 				Each student will perform a case study by adopting one software system that they will use to illustrate  				the techniques with concrete examples. Based on the case study, two slides should be prepared weekly that  				illustrate the findings in the example system. 				 				Poster 				Each student will create a poster, which is based on a new "invention". Specifically,  				at the end of the quarter each student will present a new technique, a new modeling  				notation, a new approach, a new tool, or any other new "thing" that they invent as  				a result of their experience in the class. The technique will not have to be fully  				demonstrated, but the concept and novelty should be clear from the poster. 				 				Grades 				All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class  				attendance and participation, (b) presentation(s) in class, (c) case study slides,  				and (d) poster.

The online evaluation window for winter quarter   will run from TBA through TBA.   Cheating. The UCI   academic honesty policy applies. Consequences of   cheating in this class:   a letter in your UCI file, and the course grade is lowered,   most likely to   F. Material that is copied from books or Web pages needs to   be quoted and   the source must be given.  If you plagarize, you run the severe risk   of failing the class, in a most disgraceful manner.  Disabilities.  If you need an accommodation because of a disability, please contact the instructor and the Disability Services Center as soon as possible.     (C) University of California, 2008.

The Code Orb is the first prototype view which shows developers fine-grained information related to code volatility. The Code Orb is implemented as a series of plug-ins to the Eclipse IDE.IBM research intern: June 2010 - Sept 2010Worked in a development co-op with the Ottawa software group in the Jazz - Rational Team Concert (RTC) ¨C Versioning system group. My development effort had as objective improving the integration of the versioning features of Jazz / RTC with other versioning systems such as GIT and Subversion. Concretely, I implemented extensions to export and synchronize files maintained in Jazz / RTC with Subversion. Scalability and performance was a critical issue of this integration. Frameworks/Languages used: Eclipse plug-ins, Java, SVNKit.Calico: 2009-2010Calico is a free hand rapid design tool for the initial creative and typically informal stages of software design. Calico is designed to support the informal phases of design, with features that are designed to amplify good creative design practices. I worked as developer extending the functionalities of the tool and afterward I performed usability evaluations of some of the newer functionalities of the tool and drafting research results from these experiences. Calico is a Java stand-alone application.Change Based PLAs and CM: 2008-2009I was lead developer for a research project were we integrated change-based SCM tool implemented in JEE technology and a Product Line Architecture definition environment. The integration maps the product architecture defined in xADL, EASEL and ArchStudio to a concrete implementation in Java and maintains the consistency of the implementation with its architectural definition in a change-based SCM. Frameworks/Languages used: Java, code generation with Velocity, Eclipse plug-ins.Management Game: 2007-2009In June 2007 we initiated a project to develop a support environment for the "Management Game" course taken by undergraduate students in the last semester of the Business Program at University of Los Andes. My role in the project was as lead Software Architect in charge of defining and specifying the system global design, technological platform and architectural restrictions. Additionally I assisted the project leader in the implementation and testing phases of the project. Frameworks/Languages used: JEE, code generation with MDA (EMF + ATLs) DSLs (XML, XSL), Java, Java Server Faces, Hibernate.Testing in a Global Environment: 2004-2006This research project that had as main objective the definition of an appropriate testing and software defect correction process in a global software development environment and the development of process support tools and an integration platform that fulfills the requirements of an appropriate infrastructure for Internet-scale integration. My role was as designer and lead developer of an event based messaging infrastructure. Frameworks/Languages used: J2EE, Java, code generation using XMI and XSL.QualDev development Group: 2005-2009I was the leader of a development group made up mainly of undergraduate students in a capstone project course. This group is a software engineering laboratory where students learn how to use software processes, methodologies and applications as tools to produce high quality software. The group works as a laboratory to experiment with software processes and technologies. The group develops tools in the broad domain of software development process support and some of these are successfully used in real contexts. Frameworks/Languages used: J2EE, JEE, Java, PHP, JME, XML, Jena, Velocity, Hibernate, Spoon, JSF, Struts, amongst many others.

Institute for Software Research (ISR)     Established in July 1999, the University of California's Institute for Software    Research (ISR) is dedicated to   fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information      technologies; working with established companies, startups, government agencies, and standards      bodies to develop and transition the technologies to widespread and practical      application; educating the next generation of software researchers and practitioners      in advanced software technologies; supporting the public service mission of the University of California in      developing the economic basis of the State of California.    The Institute's activities are focused on:   Direct support of research projects, including funding personnel Research support services (administrative services)Conference and seminar services Technology transition The Institute extends beyond the boundaries of UC Irvine and includes faculty from a variety of institutions. The Institute's web site details the faculty, staff, and students involved, the current projects,  events, and news.     Research   My research is focused on design ¡ª the issues, techniques, and agents    involved in creating and evolving software artifacts and processes. Specific    emphases include:   software architecture:      means for designing, organizing, and describing distributed and decentralized      applications.architecture-based      software development environments: tools to support the conceptual approach,      ranging from design-time tools to implementation to run-time dynamic adaptation.  The foundational work on architectures has centered on means for describing  architectures in various styles and development of new architectural styles   (notably the "C2" components-and-connectors    style and, with Roy Fielding, the REST     style for Internet applications such as the WWW). Current work in this     domain  is directed at developing, with Michael Gorlick and Justin Erenkrantz,     the CREST style for computational exchange on the Internet.  The environment and tools work has emphases on environment architectures (see    the ArchStudio site    for details), an extensible software    architecture description language and supporting toolkit (see the     xADL web site for the details and the download), and architecture-driven      dynamic adaptation of applications. Virtually all of this work utilizes       event-based approaches. A variety of publications in this area can be found       at http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/publications.html.

The Proposal      for a School of Design at the University of California, Irvine (dated      November  2002; PDF format; 188 pages; 8.5M) recommends establishment of      a research-based  school having an interdisciplinary approach to design      and a comprehensive array  of degree programs at the bachelor's, master's,      and doctoral levels.  The School of Design proposal was transmitted   to the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate on January 13, 2003. The proposal      is no longer under active consideration, but remains a vision document for      the design research community.

INF 141 / CS 121 Information Retrieval          ??Homework ProjectsQuizzesPaper SummariesSyllabus?Academic Honesty?Students with Disability       Synopsis           Purpose. An         introduction to information retrieval including indexing, retrieval,         classifying, and clustering text and multimedia documents.          Book. Introduction         to Information Retrieval by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar         Raghavan and Hinrich Schutze           Evaluation (undergrad).          Homework/lab projects (1/3) + Quizzes (1/3) + Exam (1/3)  	Pedagogy:         - Lectures cover the material in the reading materials by placing it in         context, giving examples, and engaging in Q&As.          - Discussionss focus on implementation issues. They support the         discussion of homework projects.         - Homework projects are hands-on vehicles for learning the material.         Collaboration and knowledge exchange are encouraged in the projects, but mindless         copy of solutions (aka cheating) is not allowed.         - The quizzes are checkpoints to evaluate each student's knowledge of         the material. The quizzes cover implementation issues of the homeworks, principles         discussed in the lectures and facts stated in the reading         materials.         - The final exam challenges the student's grasp of "the big picture."         Rather than focusing on small portions of the material, it mixes         everything.

Academic Honesty  I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be accepted. Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university.   So don't risk it! If, for some reason, you can't do the homework on time or can't study for the Quiz, you're better off skipping it than cheating it. Do the math!   Students with Disability  Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs.

Study of concepts, representations, techniques, and case studies  				in structuring software systems, with an emphasis on design considerations. Topics include static and dynamic  				system structure, data models, abstractions, naming, protocols and application programmer interfaces. 				 				Structure 				The class will be discussion-oriented. Papers must have been read beforehand, and discussion will be  				seeded by questions, observations, and assertions from all students in the class. 				 				Case Study 				Each student will perform a case study by adopting one software system that they will use to illustrate  				the techniques with concrete examples. Based on the case study, a few slides should be prepared weekly that  				illustrate the findings in the example system. 				 				Poster 				Each student will create a poster, which is based on a new "invention". Specifically,  				at the end of the quarter each student will present a new technique, a new modeling  				notation, a new approach, a new tool, or any other new "thing" that they invent as  				a result of their experience in the class. The technique will not have to be fully  				demonstrated, but the concept and novelty should be clear from the poster. 				 				Grades 				All students enrolled in the course will earn a letter grade based upon: (a) class  				attendance and participation, (b) questions, obaservations, and assertions that feed                 the discussions in class, (c) case study slides, and (d) poster.

Yes, but it is helpful if you have taken courses in computer science and math, and/or have some related work experience.    Do I have to submit online letters of recommendation?  You may elect to submit online or hard copy letters of recommendation.    May I submit more than three letters of recommendation?  You may submit as many recommendation letters as you wish.    Can I attend part time or take evening classes?  M.S. students may petition to attend part time, but Ph.D. students are required to attend full time.  			   			  The Bren School does not offer evening or weekend classes at this time; all classes are offered during the day.    Can I be waived out of the TOEFL requirement?  UCI will only waive the TOEFL requirement for applicants who have completed ALL requirements for a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. degree in the U.S. prior to submitting their application.     Can the application fee be waived or deferred?  No. In order for your application to be processed, the application fee must be received.    Is on-campus housing guaranteed?  No, on-campus housing is not guaranteed.  			  Admitted students may apply for housing after they submit their Statement of Intent to Register (SIR).    Can I send photocopies of my transcripts, GRE scores and TOEFL scores?  Only official transcripts are acceptable in order to complete your application. Use institutional code 4859 to have official GRE and TOEFL scores sent from the testing agency to UCI.    Do I need to send bank certification or financial verification at the time of application?  No. Once admitted, all international students who accept the admission offer are required to submit a financial questionnaire and financial verification documents.    If I am re-applying to the program, do I need to re-submit all my documents?  You will need to submit an online application and pay the application fee in order to re-apply to the program.  			   If you are re-applying within a one-year period, you may re-use the original documents; however, we encourage you to update your file with a new statement of purpose and letters of recommendation.  GRE and TOEFL scores must be current at the time of re-application.  			  Please send an email to gcounsel@ics.uci.edu letting us know which documents you would like to re-use. 			   			  If you are re-applying after one year, you will need to re-submit all new documents.     Do you admit for the Winter or Spring quarter?  No. The Bren School only admits for the Fall quarter.    Who do I contact if I¡¯m having trouble with the online application?   Send an email to UCI Graduate Division: ogs@uci.edu. Please note that you may not make changes to your application after it has been submitted.   For Current Graduate Students   How do I advance to candidacy for the Master's degree?  Complete and submit the MS Advancement to Candidacy form one quarter prior to when you expect your M.S. degree to be conferred. To access the form click here. 			   			  Please check with the ICS Graduate Counselors for quarterly deadlines.    How often can I go on a Leave of Absence?  Up to three quarters total.    When is the Leave of Absence deadline?  The campus deadline is Friday of the third week of classes. However, ICS recommends that students submit the Leave of Absence petition by the registration deadline each quarter. To access the leave of absence form click here.    When is the deadline to apply for part-time status?  The campus deadline is noon on Wednesday of the third week of classes. However, ICS recommends that students submit the Part-Time petition by the registration deadline each quarter.    Can a Ph.D. student apply for part-time status?  No, only Master¡¯s students are eligible to apply for part-time status. To access the part-time petition click here.    What is the composition of the Ph.D. advancement committee?  The Ph.D. advancement committee is a five member committee of senate faculty. The Ph.D. advancement committee must be composed of the Chair, three general members and one outside member. The Chair of the candidacy committee must hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student's department. At least two members in addition to the Chair must hold either a primary or joint appointment in the student's department. The majority of the committee must be from the student's department. The outside member must be a UC Irvine faculty member and may not be affiliated with the student's department.  Consult with the ICS graduate counselors for more information. 			    What is the composition of the Ph.D. final defense committee?  The Ph.D. final defense committee is a three member committee of senate faculty drawn from your advancement committee.  The majority of the committee MUST be from your department. Consult with the ICS graduate counselors if changes to the composition of your defense committee occur.    Who exactly are "senate faculty?"  Senate faculty have the following titles: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Lecturer/Senior Lecturer with Security of Employment (SOE).    Can I combine my Ph.D. advancement and my topic defense?  Yes, with the consent of your advisor. To access the topic defense form click here.     Do I have to complete my courses before I can advance to candidacy for the PhD?  Yes, you must complete all required course work before you can advance to candidacy for the PhD.    Do research units count toward course requirements?  No.  Course numbers 290, 298 and 299 do not count toward course requirements.    My degree requires a "publication-quality" research paper.  Does that mean it has to be published before I can submit it to my advisor/committee?  No, the paper does not have to be published.  Your advisor/committee will assess the quality of your paper.   For Current & Prospective TAs/Readers   Who do I see regarding TA/Reader assignments?  The Department Managers.    Do I need to submit a TA/Reader application for each quarter?  Yes.? You'll need to submit a TA/Reader application each quarter you wish to serve as a TA/Reader.            		    When will I be informed of the TA/Reader appointments?  You will be notified via email as soon as you are assigned.    Do I need to fill out a TA/Reader application if I'm on a TA/Reader fellowship?  Yes.    If I've been assigned as a TA/Reader, do I get academic credit?  Yes, each quarter you are assigned as a TA/Reader, you will receive four units of academic credit by signing up for ICS 399.

There are four elements to your grade: a final exam, a   little development project that will evolve throughout the quarter, short paper   summaries, and class attendance and participation.  The final exam will entail your writing an evaluation of some sub-area of   software engineering and identifying what you believe to be promising, or at   least necessary, research directions. You'll be able to choose, in advance,   the sub-area you'll write about. The purpose here is to demonstrate that you've   thought substantively about an area of software engineering, to the point where   you can identify some important needs, trends, opportunities, insights, ...  The purpose of the development project is simply to provide a concrete point   of reference for discussion of the various techniques and ideas that will be   covered during the quarter. Most likely we'll do a requirements specification,   several designs, probably an implementation, and some analyses. To ensure that   the focus of your time is about thinking about the issues and not grinding   through loads of detail, we'll focus on a simple problem, one version of which   was  "solved" in the 1960's in less than 80 lines of commented BASIC code:   yes, it is the lunar lander "video" game! Details of this project will be forthcoming.  The short paper summaries "allow you" to   demonstrate that you've read and thought about the assigned readings. Readings   are assigned, as shown in the schedule, each week of the class. You are obliged   to write a short summary and analysis of each week's papers. The summary/analysis   should be about 500 words long (total, per week, not per reading). I am not   interested in reading a paraphrase of each paper's abstract. I am interested   in reading your assessment of each paper: what points do you believe to be   the important ones? Do you believe those points? Why or why not? What points   did the author(s) not address that they should have? Since multiple papers   are assigned you'll have to learn how to present incisive, cut-to-the-chase (CTTC) analyses in few words.   Your CTTC's on week i's topic are due as shown on the schedule.?  They must be submitted as follows: by emailwith the subject line "Informatics 211 CTTC i" where i is what you think     it is.with the summary attached as a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) documentby midnight Pacific time on the due date   Summary of Assessment:   Cut-to-the-chase summaries 30%Development project 30%   Final exam 20%   Class attendance and participation20%  No grades of incomplete (I) will be given for this course.?    Readings  The majority of the readings in the course will be papers available through the IEEE or ACM Digital Libraries. Occasionally, there will be chapters taken from books.   If you did not study software engineering as an undergraduate, the following books are recommended for background and reference.

Each talk spotlights one company.   Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:  Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School faculty and graduate students.    Your company representatives have the opportunity to meet faculty and graduate students in a relaxed and informal setting based upon interests in certain research areas.   Tech Talks are usually scheduled from 12:00 ¨C 1:30 p.m. throughout each quarter.  During this time, a senior technical representative or technology VP from your company presents on research topics and items of interests, such as software engineering, user interfaces, security and privacy to name a few.

Inter-machine communications have always been kept away from our own communication channel, audible sound in air. There are good reasons for this: the data rates are relatively low when compared to other media (e.g. electric wires, radio) and the sounds tend to be annoying. But as more and more devices support an audio channel for voice or music, that channel becomes a cheap option for transferring arbitrary information among devices that happen to be near each other. Sound is attractive for applications that do not require high bit rates and for which it is expensive to extend the hardware infrastructure with radio or infrared transmitters. Some examples of those applications are: toys; broadcasting information through the sound of TV and radio that can be picked up by devices at home or in the car; transferring names and phone numbers between cell phones; transferring business cards between PDAs; and broadcasting location-dependent information from rooms into PDAs and laptops. Sound also has some natural advantages over other media when security is at stake.        Motivated by the specific characteristics of the aerial acoustic communication paradigm used by humans and other animals, the Digital Voices project explores the use of sound as a communication medium in ubiquitous computing environments. The inter-machine aerial acoustic communications are designed along the following criteria:          The messages of these communication systems are pleasant to humans. They are either imperceptible or, if perceivable, they sound like music or familiar environment sounds such as birds, wind or water drops.  The systems are to be deployed in ordinary hardware. We utilize the existing infrastructure for voice, avoiding extra costs.          The systems are used in ordinary environments. This means that the communication has to be reasonably robust in the presence of noise such as people talking.         Listen to the sound samples on the left. For those of you who like challenges, try to decode the whole of the messages in the "Listen" list on the left. If you can do it, I would like to hear from you!

FlexiTools@SPLASH Call for Papers and Demos Organization Program Position Papers Previous Workshops               FlexiTools@SPLASH2010 SPLASH 2010 Workshop on Flexible Modeling Tools Monday, October 18, 2010, Reno Nevada, USA Submission deadline extended to August 13, 2010   Welcome   "Flexible modeling tools" hold the promise of bridging the gap between formal modeling and free-form authoring. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to explore ideas and showcase early results in this emerging field.   Both formal modeling and free-form authoring offer important benefits for software architects and designers, as well as others. Unfortunately, contemporary tools often force users to choose one style of work over the other. During the exploratory phases of design, it is more common to use white boards than modeling tools. During the early stages of architectural analysis, it is more common to use office tools like PowerPoint and Excel. These tools offer ease of use, freedom from strict representation rules, and the ability to prepare attractive presentations for a variety of stakeholders. However, users miss out on the clarity, consistency, and completeness that can accrue from using modeling tools, as well as the powerful visualization, navigation, manipulation, and guidance that semantics-driven tools can provide.   At this workshop, people who build tools and people who use tools for software development will discuss the reasons for the current state of the practice, and will focus on tools users' needs and tool capabilities to address those needs. Papers and live demonstrations will present work on free-form authoring tools and formal modeling tools, as well as hybrid tools that aim to achieve the benefits of both.

Robbins,         SIGIR, 2003          Commentary: "This paper addresses an increasingly important problem         - how to search and manage personal collections of electronic         information. ... it addresses an important user-centered problem.         ...this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system         useful. ..., the paper includes large scale, user-oriented testing that         demonstrates the efficacy of the system. ..., the evaluation uses both         quantitative and qualitative data to make its case. I think this paper         is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people         manage their files for a decade. Moreover, it is well-written and can         serve as a good model for developers doing system design and         evaluation, and for students learning about IR systems and         evaluation."  	4. "Simple,         Proven Approaches to Text Retrieval" by Robertson and Jones           Commentary: "This paper provides a brief but well informed and         technically accurate overview of the state of the art in text         retrieval, at least up to 1997. It introduces the ideas of terms and         matching, term weighting strategies, relevance weighting, a little on         data structures and the evidence for their effectiveness. In my view it         does an exemplary job of introducing the terminology of IR and the main         issues in text retrieval for a numerate and technically well informed         audience. It also has a very well chosen list of references."

"The         Web As a Graph" by R. Kumar, P Raghavan, S. Rajagopalan, D.         Sivakumar, A. Tomkins, E. Upfal, PODS 2000          Abstract: "The pages and hyperlinks of the World-Wide Web may be         viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph. This graph has about a         billion nodes today, several billion links, and appears to grow         exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical,         sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph.         We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph,         addressing problems from Web search, automatic community discovery, and         classification. We then recall a number of measurements and properties         of the Web graph. Noting that traditional random graph models do not         explain these observations, we propose a new family of random graph         models."

The 	  work is mainly conducted in the iPubmed project 	  (http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu), which can support instant, fuzzy search 	  on more than 21 million medical publications.  He has been doing a 	  startup, called SRCH2, to commercialize the techniques.  The company 	  has spent the last few years developing a new full text search 	  software from the ground up.  Here are some of the things SRCH2 can 	  do: it resides wholly in-memory, deploys multi-threaded queries, uses 	  cached forward indexing to enable instant recommendations, does rapid 	  geo search, error correction, customizable rankings, with real-time 	  updates, all in parallel, in scale. Each feature addresses significant 	  pain points for our growing list of enterprise mobile, social, and 	  e-commerce clients.

"The         Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine" by S.         Brin and L. Page (this link is to the long version, the short version         was publishied in WWW1998)          Commentary: "This paper (and the work it reports) has had more         impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area. A major         contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search         results are greatly more valued by searchers than others. By reflecting         this in their evaluation procedures, Brin and Page were able to see the         true value of web-specific methods like anchor text. The paper presents         a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which         now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over         billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at         the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection,         high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and         context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers         had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency,         scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper         showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer         attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this         must be the first port of call."

"Indexing         by latent semantic analysis" by (Deerwester, Dumais, et.al)          Commentary: " IR, as a field, hasn't directly considered the issue         of semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the few         that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis (LSA)         applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a growing         ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by the term         "semantic space". LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility         with human information processing across a variety of information         processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way         which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads.         Finally, the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to         have increased markedly in recent years. The above paper has also made         an impact outside our field. For example, recent work on latent         semantic kernels (machine learning) draws heavily on LSI.

" 	Unsupervised         Named-Entity Extraction from the Web: An Experimental Study "         (Etzioni, et.al.)          Commentary: "This paper represents a new generation of IR work that         attempts to do more than build a bag of words for information         retrieval, but also attempts to make some sense of the information as         well."

Those who break my trust at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university.   So don't risk it! If, for some reason, you can't do the homework on time or can't study for the Quiz, you're better off skipping it than cheating it. Do the math!

Topics span the fields of human-computer interaction, software engineering, and knowledge representation. Example systems that provide intelligent assistance will be explored, as well as systems that provide new programming paradigms.  Prerequisites  A general background in      software development and algorithms and graduate student standing. Ask      instructor if uncertain.?   Grading  20% Class Participation 20% Class Presentation 60% Term Project   Term projects will generally be original commentaries on a specific theme in the research literature but may document an original research project provided it is well contextualized in the literature. Term projects will be approximately 15-20 double-spaced pages per student, including bibliography and figures, of a reasonable font (e.g. Times size 11 or Tahoma size 10).  Class participation includes attendance and discussion.  The class presentation may include 2 or even 3 students, given the size of the class and may be one of the listed papers or a paper or technology closely related. Presentations should be planned to be 20 minutes to allow lots of time for discussion.   Lectures  Week 1 ¡ª Overview and Example Technologies ¡ª October 2 and 4  ¡°Interaction¡± is the paradigm most software systems follow today. Since the advent of computers, software has been integrated into increasing numbers of domains, from the scientific, to the professional, to the domain of everyday life. A variety of interdisciplinary techniques are required in order to adequately discuss and develop these systems.  This class will explore issues related to the development of interactive systems, i.e., systems that must accommodate the needs of human users. The class brings together ideas from human-computer interaction, software engineering, and knowledge representation. Issues pertaining to the architecture and theory behind interactive systems will be examined. Evaluation methods adapted from cognitive psychology and anthropology will be reviewed with examples of their application, their strengths and weaknesses. Example systems that seek to provide intelligent assistance will be explored, as well as systems that provide new programming paradigms. Many of the examples are themselves in the domain of software and programming. The seminar concludes with speculation about the software environments of the future, including both an examination of their nature and a look at their development needs.  Students will read articles from the literature (about four to six per week) and most of the weekly class time will be spent discussing these (20%). Each student will do a presentation and lead a discussion on one article (20%). Students will also be expected to document a term project. The project may be individual or group, and may involve system development, user observations, or additional literature research (60%).  Below are some samples of what I mean by ¡°knowledge-based¡± user interfaces. However, bear in mind, this phrase encompasses a large group of systems.   Readings  [1]??????? Robbins, J., Redmiles, D.

More about the degree... Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design,  application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond  technical design to focus on the relationship between information system  design and use in real-world settings.  These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new  approaches to system design and development, new means of information  system implementation and deployment, and new models of interaction  between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings. In the Bren School, Informatics is concerned with software  architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming  languages, ubiquitous computing, information retrieval and management,  human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and  other topics that lie at the relationship between information technology  design and use in social and organizational settings.  Effective design requires an ability to analyze things from many  different perspectives, including computer science, information science,  organizational science, social science, and cognitive science.  Relevant courses in those disciplines are therefore an integral part  of the program and give this concentration a unique interdisciplinary  flavor, which is imperative as the computing and information technology  fields play such a pervasive role in our daily lives.

CS 261, Fall 2011: Data Structures  This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 10:00 - 10:50 in MSTB 118. I will also have office hours Mondays and Tuesdays from 2:00 - 3:00 in my office, Bren 4214. Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, one midterm and a comprehensive final exam. Grading will be based 20% on homework, 35% for the midterm, and 45% for the final. The reader assigned to the course is Leila Jalali .  There is no required textbook; however, much of the course material will be drawn from the Wikipedia articles collected together in the Wikipedia "book" Fundamental Data Structures. Additionally, suggested internet readings for the topics covered here will be linked from the schedule of topics.  This course may be used as part of the comprehensive exam in the   computer science masters program. To pass the comprehensive exam,   students must score at least 66% of the possible points on the final   examination for the course.

Do not rely on it entirely but rather as a reference point. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a student project created by Jonathan Farnworth and not endorsed by UC Irvine. According to the developer, ¡°The possibility of bugs is real (but hopefully very small).¡± Questions or concerns about the tool should be sent to UCI.QuarterPlanner@gmail.com.  Bren School online prerequisite clearing request To guarantee that all Bren School students take courses in the correct sequence, without violating any course requirements, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences has instituted a procedure for checking prerequisites.  Before the start of any academic quarter, all students can enroll in their classes electronically through WebReg.  Course Enrollment Deadlines: Drop a course by end of week 2 Change a grade option by end of week 2 Add a course by end of week 3 See the  Enrollment Exceptions Chart for other deadlines If a student encounters any problems enrolling in a course and if the student has satisfied the course prerequisites via any of the following: AP exam credit, Transfer school credit for a course prerequisite, Access UCI credit for a course prerequisite, Course credit by student petition for a course prerequisite, Enrollment in the prerequisite course this upcoming Summer, the WebReg system will not recognize this course credit and will block the student from enrolling with the error message of "prerequisite(s) not met" then it is possible to have the prerequisite cleared by an academic counselor for the department/school offering the course.  Below you will find instructions on how to clear the prerequisites for a:  Bren School course  A UC Irvine course offered by another department   ¡ü Back to top    Enrolling in a Bren School Course (CS, CSE, ICS, In4matx, Stats) If you have satisfied course prerequisites for a Bren School course outside of UC Irvine and anticipate receiving a "prerequisite(s) not met" error message via WebReg, please do the following: ? Go to your online Holds/Authorizations list located on your StudentAccess page. At this site, you will find a comprehensive list of courses for which you were previously authorized to enroll in by campus academic counselors.  After verifying that you have not been previously authorized for the Bren School course, sign up on the Online Prerequisite Clearing Request Form before your registration window opens.Students may check the Online Prerequisite Clearing Request Form to view progress on their request. Once you have been cleared to enroll in the Bren School course listed on your request, it should remain in the system for future use (should you choose to register for a different course instead of the course for which you requested clearance). Restrictions/Comments/Notes about the Online Prerequisite Clearing Request FormPlease note- we strongly discourage students from procrastinating and requesting clearance immediately before or after their registration windows open. Clearing students for course enrollment takes time as academic counselors and peer advisors must thoroughly review each student's file. If there is high demand, it can take us up to one week to process all requests. We will not clear students who do not meet the prerequisites of the course. Please speak with an academic counselor or peer advisor if you have scheduling concerns. Student requests are processed on a first come, first served basis. There are no exceptions to this rule. At present, the WebReg system is set up to allow removal of the registration block and is not set up to define satisfaction of a specific prerequisite. For example, if you would like to register for In4matx 131 and have satisfied the ICS/CSE 21 prerequisite at another educational institution, we can clear you to enroll in the course but cannot define satisfaction of ICS/CSE 21 for future use in WebReg. You will have to sign up again for clearance of a course that has the same prerequisite of ICS/CSE 21 such as In4matx 161. We will not accept any e-mail or phone requests to clear the registration block. You must use the online form to make this request. If you are taking the course prerequisite in the upcoming Summer Session, we may need you to bring proof of enrollment to the Student Affairs Office.  If you do not see the course on the Online Prerequisite Clearing Request Form, it usually means that the prerequisite is something you can only take at UCI which will automatically be recognized by WebReg. If you believe that you may have an exception to this, please see Abbey at the front desk of the ICS Student Affairs Office and she will assist you. ¡ü Back to top    Enrolling in a course not offered by the Bren School Please contact the student affairs office or department office (if indicated) of the school offering the course you intend to enroll in.

During this panel discussion, faculty give advice about graduate school  applications, the admissions process, Masters vs. Ph.D. programs, what  the top-tier schools look for, how to improve an application, and many  other concerns students often have about graduate school. ¡ü Back to top    Tutoring Assistance  Tutoring assistance is available through LARC (Learning and Academic Resource Center) for selected courses. Tutoring assistance in writing is available through the UCI Writing Center for selected courses. For lower division math courses free tutoring is available. In addition, the Math department has compiled a list of private tutors for math. For more information about both free and private tutoring, please visit the tutor listing page.  The Chemistry department also offers free tutoring on a walk-in basis. For more information, please visit the Chemistry tutor listing page.  Tutoring is available for the Physics 3 and 7 series. In addition, a private tutor can be hired for physics courses.  The ICS Student Affairs Office has compiled a list of tutors for hire listed below as a resource for students.  Please note that we do not screen students who wish to either hire tutors or be employed as a tutor, and act only as a conduit for posting tutor contact information on this site.  Here are some guidelines we recommend you follow: PAYMENT:Negotiate and make arrangements regarding payment before scheduling an appointment. TUTORING LOCATION: For your own safety, consider meeting each other on campus such as the Langson or Science Libraries, a campus dining location, or the ICS 3rd floor lab.

Introduction to the state-of-the art and future challenges in all the different communities focusing on the "disappearing computer" paradigm, with emphasis on the  differences between the Ubiquitous Computing model and the Desktop Computing model. Ubicomp systems have been challenging the traditional architectural divisions established for desktop computing. Therefore it is important for Computer Scientists to be aware of the new interactions and challenges that are emerging. The reading materials focus on overviews, trends and case studies. The project work provides hands-on experience with developing applications for small devices.       Format.  Lectures + Students' presentations of assigned papers                Evaluation.

More about the degree... Biology and medicine have become data-intensive information sciences.  Massive data acquisition technologies, such as genome sequencing,  high-throughput drug screening, and DNA arrays, generate biological  information in quantities that overwhelm conventional approaches.  Cost-effective health care and quality medical decision-making  require integrating large amounts of up-to-date information and  knowledge.  Biological systems have also inspired computer science advances with  new concepts, including genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks,  computer viruses and synthetic immune systems, DNA computing, artificial  life, and hybrid VLSI-DNA gene chips.  New computational opportunities such as these create a critical need  for theoretical and algorithmic advances in storing, retrieving,  networking, processing, analyzing, and visualizing biomedical  information. Informatics in Biology and Medicine is an interdisciplinary  concentration at the interface between computer sciences, biological  sciences, and medicine. It addresses problems that are specific to the  information technologies in biology, medicine, and health care.  Research topics include gene finding, protein structure and function  prediction, structural and functional genomics, proteomics, electronic  patient record systems, medical decision support systems,  guideline-based health care, medical information access, and  human-computer interfaces for medical applications.  To make advances in these areas, society needs people with knowledge  and skills that bridge those taught in conventional biological, medical,  and computer science curricula. This area provides for such an  interdisciplinary computer science education.      More Graduate ?

Underlying principles emphasized. State-of-the-art software engineering and promising research areas covered, including project management. Formerly ICS 221.                                  Detailed Description:                 This class has two objectives: (1) provide a useful overview of the state of the art (2) introduce some of the research frontiers of the field. It accomplishes this through a mix of presentations and assignments focused on the state of the art, and readings from the research literature.                                                                                                             Schedule (tentative)                                                                                                                                                          Grading and Evaluations                                                                                                            Grading:                 There are four elements to your grade: a final exam, a research proposal project, short paper summaries, and class attendance and participation.                                  The final exam will entail your writing an evaluation of some sub-area(s) of software engineering and identifying what you believe to be promising, or at least necessary, research directions. You'll be able to choose, in advance, the sub-area(s) you'll write about. The purpose here is to demonstrate that you've thought substantively about an area of software engineering, to the point where you can identify some important needs, trends, opportunities, insights, ...                                  The proposal project will require you to explore some avenue of possible research. You¡¯ll write a proposal for possible research much in the same way that proposals are written for research grants. When attending class and hearing our outside lecturers and when reading your reading assignments, you should be thinking of possible research projects that can take a new direction, or continue in their current direction, of research. Your proposal will be at most 10 pages (11 point font, Times New Roman). It should explain the motivation of why this area of research is needed and interesting, what has been done in the past (background section), why the existing research is not sufficient to produce your desired effects, your proposed approach, any evidence that supports that this is a good direction, and the people with which you intend to collaborate to perform this research. I recommend that you start thinking of possible projects early in the course, and when we have guest speakers, ask them questions to help shape that direction. You may schedule a meeting with them to discuss whether certain of your ideas have already been explored, what good background papers you should cite, etc.                                  The short paper summaries "allow you" to demonstrate that you've read and thought about the assigned readings. Readings are assigned, as shown in the schedule, each week of the class. You are obliged to write a short summary and analysis of each week's papers. I am not interested in only reading a paraphrase of each paper's abstract. I am interested in reading your assessment of each paper: what points do you believe to be the important ones? Do you believe those points? Why or why not? What points did the author(s) not address that they should have? Since multiple papers are assigned you'll have to learn how to present incisive, cut-to-the-chase (CTTC) analyses in few words.                                  Your CTTC's on each topic are due the night before class at midnight (i.e., the night before the discussion of those papers). They will then be ¡°graded¡± by you the next morning before class ¡ª details will be given in class.                                  They must be submitted as follows:                                                       ?EEE dropbox --- use the dropbox for the particular assignment                                        ?as a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) document                                        ?by midnight Pacific time on the due date                                                                      Summary of Assessment:                 Cut-to-the-chase summaries: 25%                 Proposal project: 30%                 Final exam: 25%                 Class attendance and participation: 20%                                  No grades of incomplete (I) will be given for this course.

Once the dates for evaluations are known, this information will be posted here.                                  Cheating                 The UCI academic honesty policy applies. Consequences of cheating in this class: a letter in your UCI file, and the course grade is lowered, most likely to F. Material that is copied from books or Web pages needs to be quoted and the source must be given. If you plagiarize, you run the severe risk of failing the class, in a most disgraceful manner.                                  Disabilities                 If you need an accommodation because of a disability, please contact the instructor and the Disability Services Center as soon as possible.

For this, you should prepare an oral summary (10-15 minutes) of the paper, and create some discussion points to lead the class discussion (e.g. one slide). The discussion points could be any thoughts you have about the paper, such as anything you think is controversial in the paper, comments about research methodology, questions about things that are unclear in the paper, ideas for follow up research, strengths and weaknesses of the paper, etc. Try to choose open ended questions/issues that will provoke some class discussion.

There has never been a more important time to consider diversity in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. The field of computer science is changing rapidly, and an academic body with a diverse background can contribute unique ideas and perspectives to the creative development and study of new technologies for a global world. However, we are still a long way from achieving this goal. To quote from a 2010 report from the President¡¯s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology:   ¡°Moreover, there is a large interest and achievement gap among some groups in STEM, and African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and women are seriously underrepresented in many STEM fields. This limits their participation in many well-paid, high-growth professions and deprives the Nation of the full benefit of their talents and perspectives.¡± (pg. viii)  1    One of the ways we can achieve a more inclusive climate is to educate ourselves on the importance of diversity in our field. To this end, I will use this site to assemble articles that relate to issues concerning women and underrepresented minorities regarding educational achievement, advancement, pay inequity and other topics. If you have any questions regarding our equity program, or if you'd like to suggest articles for posting on this site, please send a message to advance@ics.uci.edu.   I hope you enjoy learning more about this important topic as I have.    Your ICS equity advisor,Gloria Mark               Bren Professor Judy Olson with members of the student organization Women in Computer Sciences (WICS).      Articles of interest  Click here for a collection of articles about diversity in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Please check the list regularly, as new articles will continue to be posted.               More than 30 students earned their Ph.D. from the Bren School during the 2010-11 academic yeaer.       How we compare to the rest of the nation  Here¡¯s how the Bren School compares with the rest of the country on gender equity in terms of degrees awarded and faculty gender ratio. Data is taken from the CRA Taulbee report, 2009-10 (latest available). Though on some measures we perform better than the rest of the nation, on others we fare poorly in comparison. This data shows that we have a long way to go. More details can be found here. (PDF document)   ?  Degree recipients: nationwide (2009-2010)              ?

Term Project 70%  Debate 20%  Participation 10%   Term Project. The term project for this course will consist of original research on a topic software process.  The project will be undertaken in teams of two. A report describing the research is due at the last meeting of the course. The project will consist of a field study of industrial software process.   The final report is due Friday, March 18, 2011. Sections of the  report will be due at various points in the quarter.   Debate. During the early portion of the course, we will be pairs of papers that present opposing views of software process. Discussion of these papers will begin with a debate. The debate will consist of four students, two in favor and two against a resolution, using a parliamentary debate format.   Participation. Participation in the course will be evaluated in two ways. 1) Participation during class time. This includes attendance, active listening, and contributing to the discussion. 2) Students are required to make one post each week on the course MessageBoard. This post must be made before 9am on the day of class. During the weeks when there will be a debate, students not involved in the debate are expected to post their position The position must be substantiated by an argument. During the weeks when we will be discussing research projects, the post should be related to the project-- a progress report, a question or problem, a refinement of a previous idea or method, etc.       Policies  Cheating. The UCI academic honesty policy applies. Consequences of cheating in this class: A letter in your UCI file, and the course grade is lowered, possibly to F. Material that is copied from books or Web pages needs to be quoted and the source must be given.     Disabilities.  If you need an accommodation because of a disability, please contact the instructor and the Disability Services Center as soon as possible.    (C) University of California, 2005.

The UCI General Catalogue  is the official guide to all degree and graduation requirements; the information  below is intended for general planning purposes only.   Software Engineering (SE) (M.S. and Ph.D.)   The field of Software Engineering is concerned with the creation and analysis of the complex software systems that underlie modern society. Research in Software Engineering targets software artifacts and the people that create them. The field is large, and it encompasses engineering design research, i.e. the creation of new software artifacts with some desirable properties, as well as empirical research, i.e. the study of the effects that software development tools and methods have in the context of software development teams. Topics include software architectures, testing and debugging, software development tools, formal languages, requirements engineering, mining of large software-related data sources, reverse engineering, and development processes.   The Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering (SE) offers students opportunities for graduate study in the spectrum of intellectual activity in SE. The M.S. degree in SE complements undergraduate knowledge in related fields with a solid framework for understanding the development of complex software systems.   Fall 2012 to Current Course Requirements  Degree Core: The MS and Ph.D degrees will not be awarded to students who currently hold a MS or Ph.D degree in software engineering or a related field from the same or another university.  All MS and Ph.D. students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 throughout the program. Failure to maintain this minimum will result in a recommendation that the student be disqualified. In addition, no grade lower than B is counted towards satisfying any course requirements.  Students must complete the two introductory research courses (INF 200A and INF 200B), four software engineering courses, four elective courses, and two quarters of seminars, literature survey, and individual study courses.  Research Overview INF 200A Introduction to Informatics AINF 200B Introduction to Informatics B Software Engineering Core Courses INF 211 Software EngineeringINF 212 Analysis of Programming LanguagesINF 215 Software Analysis and TestingINF 221 Software Architecture Software Engineering Electives Four elective courses chosen from the following courses offered by the School of ICS, all 4 units. The set of elective courses chosen by the student must be approved by the student¡¯s research advisor. With the advisor¡¯s permission, the student may substitute other non-seminar courses, as long as they are related to the student¡¯s research interests INF 213 Formal Specification and ModelingINF 217 Software ProcessesINF 219 Software EnvironmentsINF 223 Applied Software DesignINF 231 Human-Computer InteractionINF 233 Knowledge-Based User InterfacesINF 235 Advanced User Interface ArchitectureINF 241 Introduction to Ubiquitous ComputingINF 242 Ubiquitous Computing and InteractionINF 251 Computer-Supported Cooperative WorkINF 261 Social Analysis of ComputingINF 269 Computer LawCS 203 Network and Distributed Systems SecurityCS 221 Information Retrieval, Filtering, and ClassificationCS 222 Principles of Data ManagementCS 225 Next Generation Search SystemsCS 230 Distributed Computer SystemsCS 232 InternetCS 235 Internet TechnologyCS 237 Middleware for Networked and Distributed SystemsCS 241 Advanced Compiler ConstructionCS 273A Machine LearningCS 277 Data Mining Seminars and Individual Study INF 209S Seminar in Informatics (2 quarters; 2 units each)INF 291S Literature Survey (2 quarters; 2 units each)INF 299 Individual Study (2 quarters, 4 units each)  MS Thesis/Examination  M.S. students must complete the two introductory research courses (INF 200A and INF 200B), four software engineering courses, four elective courses, and two quarters of seminars (INF 290S). Students doing Capstone Plan I (Thesis) must complete two quarters, four units each, of Thesis Supervision (INF 298); students doing Capstone Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) must complete two quarters of literature survey courses.?The course requirements are identical to the Ph.D. degree, diverging only in making the Literature Survey and the Individual Study courses mutually exclusive, depending on the students¡¯ Capstone option.?Capstone Requirement?? Plan I ¨C Thesis Option: Students must take and pass the Research Assessment examination. Additionally, students are required to defend their thesis in a public exam according to UCI Senate Policy. This requirement must be completed by the end of the second year.?? Plan II ¨C Comprehensive Examination Option: Students must take the written Comprehensive examination, and obtain an M.S. PASS or higher. This requirement must be completed by the end of the second year. In case of FAIL, the exam may be re-taken once more. A second FAIL results in disqualification of the student from the Masters program. Ph.D Written Comprehensive Exam Students must pass a written examination testing their knowledge of the relevant topics and literature in Software Engineering and their ability to formulate clear arguments in writing and under time constraints. This examination is based on a predetermined reading list maintained by the program faculty. Preparation for this exam is done during two quarters of INF 291S. This exam is administered at most twice a year.?The exam is graded a Ph.D. PASS, M.S. PASS or FAIL. In case of M.S. PASS or FAIL, it may be re-taken once more, within twelve months, in an attempt to qualify for a Ph.D. PASS. A second M.S. PASS or FAIL results in disqualification of the student from the doctoral program (with or without a terminal M.S. degree). Ph.D Research Assessment Students must find a faculty advisor and successfully complete a research project with that faculty member. The research project should be done over at least two quarters of independent study with that faculty member. The goal of this research assessment is to introduce the student to the practice of scientific publication.?Based on the project, the student must produce a research paper of publishable quality. This research paper must be reviewed by three faculty members in a peer-review process, revised by the student, and approved by the three faculty members.?The research assessment is graded PASS or FAIL. In case of FAIL, the student can re- submit the paper at most one more time within the maximum period of six months. A second FAIL results in disqualification from the program. Ph.D Advancement to Candidacy Exam Each Ph.D. student must pass the oral advancement to candidacy exam, which assesses the student¡¯s ability to conduct, present, and orally defend research work at the doctoral level. The research project and paper are the basis for the student¡¯s oral advancement to candidacy exam. The oral candidacy exam consists of the research presentation by the student, followed by questions from the candidacy committee.?The student must complete the course requirements, and pass the two qualifying examinations prior to advancing to candidacy. The candidacy committee will consist of five faculty members, the majority of whom must be members of the student¡¯s program, and is conducted in accordance with UCI Senate regulations. Ph.D Dissertation Topic Defense The student must present a carefully articulated document representing the student¡¯s dissertation plan. This document must include the proposed dissertation abstract, a discussion of the approach, a comprehensive survey of related work, and a plan for completing the work. The dissertation plan is presented by the student to the dissertation committee, who must unanimously approve the student¡¯s proposal. The dissertation defense committee is formed in accordance to UCI Senate regulations. Ph.D Doctoral Dissertation and Final  Examination Students are required to complete a doctoral dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations. In addition, they must pass an oral thesis defense which consists of a public presentation of the student¡¯s research followed by an oral examination by the student¡¯s doctoral committee. The committee must approve the thesis unanimously.          More Graduate ?

Informatics  Ph.D. Degree Milestones (PDF, 24kb)    Research Project for the Ph.D.  Each student must find an Informatics faculty advisor and successfully  complete a research project with that faculty member by the end of the  second year.  The research project should be done over at least two  quarters of independent study or thesis supervision (Informatics 299 or  298) with that faculty.  Written Assessment for the Ph.D.  Each student must pass a written assessment.  Students in the SW and ICT  tracks must pass a written examination regularly administered by the  department.  This examination is based on predetermined reading lists  maintained by the SW and ICT faculty.  Students in the UBICOMP and GEN  tracks must describe the research project in a publication-quality  report, which must be approved by three UBICOMP and Informatics faculty.    - Written  Assessment Timeline/Procedures (PDF, 47kb)  Candidacy Examination for the Ph.D.  Each student must pass the oral advancement to candidacy examination,  which assesses the student¡¯s ability to conduct, present, and orally  defend research work at the doctoral level.   Students in the UBICOMP and GEN tracks, additionally to questions  about the presented research, will also be asked questions about a  predetermined list of papers.  In the case of UBICOMP, that list is  maintained by the UBICOMP faculty; in the case of GEN, that list is to  be determined by the student¡¯s committee. Dissertation Topic Defense  The student must present a dissertation plan that includes the proposed  dissertation abstract, a dissertation outline, a comprehensive survey of  related work, and a detailed plan for completing the work.  This plan  must be unanimously approved by the dissertation committee.   Doctoral Dissertation and Final Examination    The student is required to complete a doctoral dissertation in  accordance with Academic Senate Policy.  The student must also pass an  oral dissertation defense which consists of a public presentation of the  student's research followed by an oral examination by the student's  doctoral committee.  The dissertation must be approved unanimously by  the committee.    More about the degree... Ubiquitous computing addresses the emergent trend of moving beyond  the desktop computer and embedding computation into the environment.  With the proliferation of palm devices, cell phones, digital cameras, smart sensors, and so on, some   of this paradigm shift has already  happened. A lot more must happen to make computers blend with the  environment.  Moving beyond the desktop into a model where computers are  ubiquitous has important consequences in every aspect of computing  systems development, from hardware and software design to HCI to    social aspects of computing. And, as with any good paradigm shift, this one doesn't invalidate the pre-existing models, concepts and tools:  it expands them. The field of ubiquitous computing, as such, is a vibrant research  area. Specific research emphases of the UBICOMP faculty include    programming models and tools for pervasive systems, experimental design research involving sensor- rich systems, and empirical studies of  ubiquitous computing technology.

Each information session spotlights one company.   Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:  Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School students.    Your human resources personnel have the opportunity to meet potential candidates in a relaxed and informal setting.    Students receive a chance to educate themselves about your company.   Information sessions are usually scheduled from 12:00 ¨C 1:00 p.m.  or 5:00-7:00 p.m. throughout each quarter.  During the first 20¨C30 minutes, company representatives give a general overview of the company, highlighting aspects such as company culture and employment opportunities.  The next 15-20 minutes are used as a formal question and answer period.  The remaining time is dedicated to informal conversation and resume collection.  During this time, students often speak one-on-one with company representatives to ask further questions.   CURRENTLY These sessions are free of charge; however, most companies choose to provide pizza and sodas to encourage student participation.    ?

The goal of the M.S. concentration in Knowledge Discovery and Data is  to educate students in both the fundamental principles of computational  methods for modeling data, as well as to provide a broad foundation in  emerging methods for knowledge discovery and data mining.  Technological advances in digital data collection, memory capacity,  and computational power have revolutionized our view of data analysis in  recent years. The volumes of data being collected in science, business,  medicine, and government are truly vast in nature.  Across all of these areas, there is a rapidly increasing demand for  better theories and tools to provide users with improved understanding  of their data and to leverage their data for decision support. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is an emerging discipline  within computer science, focused on the principles of how patterns and  structure can be inferred from large data sets. It is an area of  significant academic interest and research opportunity.  For example, a Special Interest Group in Knowledge Discovery in  Databases (SIGKDD) was recently started by the Association for Computing  Machinery (ACM) to promote both research and professional activities in  this area; a journal called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery was  started in 1997; and the field sponsors an annual international  conference with over 500 attendees.  In addition, the National Science Foundation has recently begun a  large interdisciplinary research program in Knowledge and Distributed  Intelligence (KDI), based in part on recent research and interest in  KDD.  Industry participation is also very active with broad demand for  graduates in this area, across a wide variety of companies engaged in  leveraging scientific and business data for strategic purposes.

More about the degree...  As digital technologies infiltrate increasingly diverse aspects of  cultural practice, and human culture at large is influenced by the  presence of digital technologies, there is a profound need for a new  type of professional in the entertainment industry, in education, and in  the arts, who can help to construct, manage, and monitor these changes.   Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically  skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous  level. The goal of the M.S. concentration in Critical Practices in Arts,  Science and Technology (CPAST) is to provide students with a  broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the intersection of  digital technology and cultural and artistic practices.  Students must apply and be accepted directly to this program. Strongly practical in composition, the CPAST program provides  students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as  telematic performance, immersive and augmented environments, embodied  interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies.

More about the degree... UCI enjoys an international reputation for its research on the human  and social dimensions of computer system design and use. There are two  principal strands to this work. The first concerns the interaction  between people and computers, including novel forms of interactive  experience beyond traditional desktop computing. The second concerns the  role that computer systems can play in collaborative work between  individuals, groups, and organizations.  Examples of topics that ICT researchers investigate include: adoption  and diffusion of collaborative technologies; software architectures for  user-adaptive systems; universal access to interactive systems; design  principles for information visualization; and new patterns of  computer-mediated work such as virtual teams. The approach used places equal emphasis on three areas of  investigation--empirical, theoretical, and technical. The empirical work  involves studying technology in use, using both laboratory techniques  and fieldwork investigations of real-world settings. The theoretical  research employs and develops analytic understanding of the  relationships among technology, people, organizations, and social  settings. Finally, in the technical work, ICT researchers develop new  models and technologies for interaction with and collaboration through  technology. Students in the ICT track gain a thorough grounding in all  three areas. The cornerstone of this approach is to study real use of technology,  as it occurs in real-world settings. ICT researchers believe that the  success or failure of technology depends on how people can fit that  technology into real practice, balancing technical, cognitive, social,  and cultural dimensions.  Using an interdisciplinary approach, ICT research aims at a deeper  understanding of interaction with and collaboration through technology,  and at exploiting these insights for the design of better systems.

More about the degree... The goal of this program is to prepare students for challenges in  developing future embedded systems. These future systems will further  integrate communications, multimedia, and advanced processors with  complex embedded and real-time software for automotive, medical,  telecommunications, and many other application domains. Furthermore, embedded systems are becoming parallel, deploying  multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip and parallel application software. An  in-depth knowledge of the underlying scientific and engineering  principles is required to understand these advances and to productively  contribute to development of such systems. This program helps students master embedded system fundamentals,  advanced computer architecture and compilers, networking, security,  embedded, parallel and distributed software, and computer graphics in a  sequence of courses and labs. Students also complete a large embedded  systems project and may choose to write a Master's thesis.      More Graduate ?

FlexiTools@SPLASH Call for Papers and Demos Organization Program Position Papers Previous Workshops                FlexiTools@SPLASH2010 SPLASH 2010 Workshop on Flexible Modeling Tools Monday, October 18, 2010, Reno Nevada, USA Submission deadline extended to August 13, 2010   Call for Papers and Demonstrations         Most activities during the software lifecycle involve producing and manipulating representations of information. These range from domain analysis (such as business analysis) during the early stages of requirements engineering, through architectural and lower-level design, to coding, testing, deployment and beyond. Many of these activities, and the tools that support them, have long been of interest to the SPLASH community. The information representations are models, and hence these are modeling activities, though not typically called that in all cases. Many modeling tools exist to support modeling activities. They have a variety of advantages, such as syntax and static semantics checking, providing multiple views of models for visualization and convenience of manipulation, providing domain-specific assistance (e.g., "content assist") based on model structure, providing documentation of the modeling decisions, ensuring consistency of the models, and facilitating integration with other formal tools and processes, such as model-driven engineering (MDE) and model checking.   Despite these advantages, however, formal modeling tools are often not used for many of these activities. During the exploratory phases of design, it is more common to use white boards, pen and paper or other informal mechanisms. Free-form diagrams serve as the centerpiece of discussion and can easily evolve as discussion proceeds. During the early stages of requirements engineering, when stakeholders are being interviewed and domain understanding is being built, it is also more common to use office tools (word processors, spreadsheets and drawing/presentation tools). Free-form textual documents, tables and diagrams serve as working documents and can easily be fashioned into presentations to stakeholders that are such an important part of this activity. The documents and presentations are easy to share with stakeholders. Users are also not forced to commit too early to specific choices, and thus have freedom during highly iterative, exploratory activities.   Formal modeling tools and more informal but flexible, free-form approaches thus have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Practitioners throughout the software lifecycle must currently choose between them for each specific task. Whichever they choose, they lose the advantages of the other, with attendant frustration, loss of productivity, traceability, or even quality.   What can be done about this unfortunate dichotomy? Tools that blend the advantages of modeling tools and the more free-form approaches offer the prospect of allowing users to make tradeoffs between flexibility and precision/formality and to move smoothly between them. We refer to these as flexible modeling tools . They might be modeling tools with added flexibility, or office tools with added modeling support, or tools of a new kind. Some work has already been done in this area, much of it quite recently, for example: software design sketching tools, modeling tools that allow free-form annotation and tagging, and tools that support progression from unstructured text or diagrams to more formal representations. Successful workshops at CASCON 2009 and ICSE 2010 showed that there is considerable and diverse interest in this area. These workshops in particular began to lay the groundwork for understanding the problem, and provided some hints at possible solutions (position papers from these workshops are downloadable from the workshop web sites). But many more discussions are needed to understand how to design flexible modeling tools.   This workshop will bring together researchers from the SPLASH community who understand tool users' needs, usability, user interface design and tool infrastructure to explore these questions. The concrete goals of this workshop are to explore in depth the current dichotomy and its implications for users, leading to a list of key issues, and to discuss obstacles to flexible modeling and means to overcome them, leading to a new research agenda in flexible modeling tools.  Submission  Prospective participants are invited to submit 2-4 page position papers on any topic relevant to the dichotomy between modeling tools and more free-form tools. In particular, papers analyzing specific problems with existing tools, detailing requirements for flexible modeling tools, analyzing the usability tradeoffs involved in flexible modeling, describing approaches for architecting and building flexible modeling tools, and actual examples of such tools are all appropriate.   Alternatively, prospective participants can submit a 2-4 page description of a live demonstration they would present of a working prototype of a flexible modeling tool. The description should indicate which essential capabilities of the tool would be the focus of the demonstration.   Submissions must conform to the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings Format and must be submitted through  Easy Chair  by the submission deadline noted below. Submissions will be judged based on novelty, insightfulness, quality, relevance to the workshop, and potential to spark discussion. Accepted submissions will be posted on the workshop website.  Workshop Format  The workshop will consist of a few, brief presentations from a subset of the accepted position papers and demonstrations. Each presentation will be accompanied by considerable discussion. To fuel this discussion, all participants will be asked to prepare: Two problems they have experienced with existing modeling tools, or two tasks or situations for which modeling tools would be helpful but are not used typically used; and Two features/differences in behavior or ideas for radical new tools they would really like to see.    In addition, there will be an area where all accepted papers and demonstrations can be displayed as posters, to be viewed by all participants throughout the day.   Finally, all participants are encouraged to bring working prototypes of tools along with them. If there is sufficient interest, a SPLASH BOF will be organized to provide an opportunity to discuss and showcase tools and some of the workshop results in greater depth.   Important Dates  Submission deadline:  August 9, 2010  Extended to August 13, 2010Notification of acceptance:Friday September 3, 2010 Early Registration:Mid-September, 2010Workshop:Monday October 18, 2010  Submission  The submission URL is: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flexitools2010 Organizers  Doug Kimelman, IBM T.J.

More about the degree... Software has transformed society in dramatic and powerful ways. From  the World Wide Web to pilotless vehicles to spreadsheets, software  systems inform, control, and enhance daily activities.  Software research at UCI is aimed at creating new software technology  and solutions, furthering the information revolution. Perspectives of  engineering, science, mathematics, and human-computer interaction guide  the work. The central goal of all the research is improvement in  software development, evolution, deployment, quality, and  cost-effectiveness. Specific research emphases of the software faculty include: analysis  and testing, software understanding, empirically guided analysis,  environments, software architectures, hypermedia, workflow, user  interface software, process, formal methods, specification languages,  extensible component-based software systems, distributed event-based  systems, and programming languages.  A valuable and unusual feature of the concentration is the  opportunity to work with the Software group's industrial partners. These  companies provide opportunities for internships, support research  projects, and provide a test-bed for evaluation of new ideas.  Graduates of the program have taken careers in research universities,  industrial research laboratories, colleges, and industry.      More Graduate ?

Computer Science (CS) (M.S. and Ph.D.)  The Computer Science degree is a broad and flexible program which offers  students opportunities for graduate study in the full spectrum of intellectual  activity in computer science. more ?   Fall 2012 to Current Course Requirements  Degree Core:  The set of core and elective courses chosen by a student must be  approved by the student's research advisor before advancement to candidacy.  Faculty associated with each research area will provide suggested curricula for  that area to guide students in their selection of courses. These curricula will  also help Ph.D. students to prepare for their candidacy examination (see below)  which must be taken in a specific research area. Students must complete at least 47 units of course work with an average GPA of at least 3.5 for Ph.D. students and 3.0 for M.S. students. Students must receive a B or better in each course counted towards meeting this requirement. In addition, four of the courses used must come from the set of Core Courses listed below, and each of the four must come from a different Core area.  Required:  Three quarters of CS 200S  Core Courses: select four areas from the list of seven below. From  each area, select at least one of the courses listed for that area:  CS  260, CS 261 or CS 263: Data Structures and AlgorithmsCS  250A or CS 244: Architecture/Embedded SystemsCS  241, CS 243 or CS 230: System Software CS  271 or CS 273A: Artificial Intelligence CS  232, CS 203 or CS 212: Networks/Multimedia CS  222 or CS 223: Database Systems CS  206 or CS  211A: Scientific and Visual Computing  Electives  Students must also take seven elective courses which can be  any set of CS, Informatics or Statistics courses, including the above core  courses, but excluding 290, 298, 299, or any course with a suffix of  "S".  Two of these courses can be graduate courses offered by a department outside of ICS with written consent of the advisor. (M.S. students must obtain written consent from the Computer Science Vice Chair for Graduate Studies). Two of the courses can be undergraduate courses from the following list: CS 111, CS 112 CS 122A, CS 132, CS 142A, CS 143A, CS 152, CS 161, CS 171, CS 178, ICS 161, ICS 162, ICS 163, ICS 166. Students may not retake courses they have used toward an undergraduate degree and receive credit toward the graduate requirements. Similarly, students may not take and count undergraduate courses in areas where they have already moved into graduate-level coursework. (The purpose of these undergraduate elective options are to help students to remedy undergraduate background deficiencies). No more than two undergraduate courses or CS 295s may be taken to satisfy elective course requirements. M.S. students completing the thesis option must take two quarters of CS 298  (4 units each) with a thesis advisor; these may substitute for two electives.  Ph.D. students are requried to serve as teaching assistants for at least two quarters. MS Thesis/Examination  Each student must 1) pass a comprehensive examination given by CS faculty.  The examination covers the core requirements and is given within each core course, or 2) turn in a thesis which will be defended and approved in  accordance with UCI Senate Policy. Research project for the Ph.D.  Degree Ph.D. students must find a faculty advisor and successfully complete a  research project with that faculty member by the end of their second year. In  coordination with this project the student must take at least one independent  studies course (CS 299) with the advisor. By the end of the second year, the  student must present the outcome of the research in a technical report, which  must be approved by the advisor. Ph.D. Candidacy Exam The objective of the candidacy exam is to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of  an area of computer science and readiness to carry out independent research at  the doctoral level in that area. The student must complete all course  requirements and the research project prior to advancing to candidacy.  All requirements for candidacy including the candidacy exam must be completed  by the end of the third year (or, for students with a previous MS in computer science or a related field, by the end of the second year). If the student does not pass on the first trial,  they will be allowed until the end of the first quarter of the next year to  advance to candidacy.  The candidacy committee will consist of five faculty members, the majority of  whom must be members of the student¡¯s program, to administer the exam according  to UCI Senate Policy. Please see the ICS Graduate Office for policies  regarding the advancement committee membership.

Students with more than 60 units will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may not be admitted to the major    Students will not be able to complete the degree in Software Engineering prior to Spring 2013.  Special Programs and Learning Opportunities  			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential  learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will  help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor,  or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other  campus programs and resources that support your interests and future  goals. 			   ? CONCENTRATIONS:  Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context    All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan  that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other  requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.  The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services  and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in  multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive  international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the  concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the  history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside  the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international  host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host  country.  Application: Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a  guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be  approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student  Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a  high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic  counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education  regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to  internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic  counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified  students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as  needed.  Requirements:  A  minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an  emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary),  history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international  portion of the program, international law, international labor policy,  global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and  global economics; A  one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major  and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an  international university;A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.  ?

Homework 1 Due     10/2  Important note: The main point of the following tasks is   the experiences     that you make/made, and   not a correct/optimal solution. In cases of unfulfilled expectations, you should     state what you wanted to do, why you decided to perform some action, and     in what way that action did not deliver what you expected. ? Task 1. Describe stepwise your actions and experiences   when carrying out the following two tasks, at a level of detail that allows   one to replicate your steps.    1.1. Visit the       website of Pope John Paul II, find out which speeches he gave in January       1992 and list those speeches. Give up after 10 minutes if you don't succeed       (but still describe your experiences).       Do NOT use the Internet Explorer or Opera web browsers in       this task, and   make sure Java/JavaScript is on.   1.2. Find l listing of all ICS graduate students, starting     at http://www.ics.uci.edu (no, you do     not want the list of near graduation Ph.D.'s). You can use any browser but     not a search engine. Give up after 15 minutes if you don't succeed (but still     describe your experiences).      Task 2. Describe a usability problem that you encountered in     the past (this is not restricted to software systems, but may relate to any     man-made     system). Explain the problems that you encountered and their impacts on you     (if possible in terms of the central measurable human factors in user interface     evaluation). Describe your suggestions for improvement. Do not write more     than one page, unless you need more space to describe the problem or your solution. How to turn in your answers?   You can upload a PDF file with your answers by 10/2 11:45pm in   the Homework       1 Dropbox, or turn in a hardcopy in  class on 10/2.

FORMS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ?   Forms at the International  Center ?  POLICIES ?  Transfer of Coursework Policy  Previously taken graduate-level courses may count toward Bren School degree  requirements if they meet the following criteria:  1) Must have been passed with a grade of B or better2) Must not have  been applied toward a bachelor¡¯s degree or M.S. degree from another  university3) Cannot have been taken while the student was on a leave of  absence from the program4) Must be approved by the Bren School Associate  Dean for Student Affairs and the Dean of Graduate Division  In addition, no more than one-fifth of the total units required for your M.S.  or Ph.D. can have been transferred from another institution, from UC Extension,  or from Summer Session at any other UC campus.  Note: Students can only transfer two  courses toward their degree requirements  To transfer a course from another University, submit a general petition form.   Transcripts from the other University must also be provided when you submit  your petition to the Bren School Graduate Office. Once approved/denied, you will  receive notification via email.  Waiver of Coursework Policy  If you have taken a graduate course at another University, and believe that  it is identical to a Bren School course, please contact the Bren School  professor who usually teaches the course. He/she can determine whether or not  the course is equivalent.  If it is, he/she can sign your petition form before you submit it to the Bren  School Graduate Office.  A syllabus of the course, as well as your transcripts from the other  University, must accompany the petition.  Once approved/denied, you will receive notification via email.  Substitution of Coursework Policy  A UCI course can be substituted for another UCI course, with approval. To do  so, speak to the professor who teaches the course and to your faculty advisor.   If they agree with the substitution, have them sign the petition form and  return it to the Bren School Graduate Office. Once approved/denied, you will receive notification via email.  Leave of Absence Policy  All graduate students can petition for a leave of absence from the program  for a period of up to, but no more than, three quarters total. The LOA form is available at the Bren School Graduate Office. Submit the form  well in advance of the requested leave to make sure it gets approved.  The leave must be approved by both the Bren School Graduate Office and the  Dean of Graduate Division (the International Center, as well, for all  international students).  The Bren School Graduate Office will notify you via email once it has been  approved/denied.  Grading Policy  Traditional grades: A, B, C, etc¡­ Students are expected  to maintain a B (3.0) average (this is an absolute requirement if on a  fellowship¡ªGSR, TA, GAANN, etc.). Some fellowships require students to maintain  a GPA higher than 3.0.  In order to receive graduation credit, students must earn a grade of B or  better in all required courses.  A grade of B- or below does not have to be improved and can remain on your  transcript if that grade is not going to be counted toward your graduation  requirements.  Pass/No Pass: P/NP is for undergraduate courses only.  Graduate students should not enroll in a course for P/NP  Graduate students must receive a letter grade in all graduate courses.  Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory: S/U is for graduate courses  only and is considered to be a letter grade.  Faculty can assign an S/U instead of an A, B, C, etc. Students are  responsible for asking the professor if they can receive the S/U option instead  of an A, B, C, etc.  Please keep in mind that the S grade is equal to a B or better and the U  grade is equal to a B- or below.  If you receive a U grade, you will have to repeat the course if it is going  to count towards your degree requirements.  Incompletes: The "I" grade is reserved for occasions  when a student¡¯s work is satisfactory but is incomplete because of circumstances  beyond the student¡¯s control, and when the student has been excused in advance  from completing the quarter¡¯s work.  You may ask the professor to assign an "I", but it may or may not be granted.  If granted, you have three quarters to make up the Incomplete. If the work is not completed and a grade has not been assigned after three quarters, the "I" will turn to an F. The UCI Graduate Division will not continue to approve your student  employment (TA, GSR, etc.) if more than two Incompletes appear on your  transcript.  No Reports: NR means no grade was reported. This  can be for a variety of reasons: ? The faculty member did not submit  grades on time? The faculty member does not recognize your name on the class  roster? The faculty member turned in the wrong grade for you? The  course¡¯s grade roster was unreadableAn NR will turn into an F after one  quarter. If you receive an NR, talk to your professor immediately.   Graduate Student Review Policy  Each spring quarter the Bren School faculty conducts a formal review of all  graduate students enrolled in the graduate program. The Bren School Graduate  Office, the Bren School Associate Dean for Student Affairs, and the student¡¯s  advisor review each student¡¯s progress.  If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of probation is sent to  the student and placed in their file. The probation period varies, depending on  the individual¡¯s situation. If the problem is not cleared during the  probation period, the Bren School Graduate Office may recommend to the UCI  Graduate Division that the student be dismissed from the program.  It is the student¡¯s responsibility to make sure the Bren School Graduate  Office is aware that a problem has been cleared during the probation period.   Possible reasons for probation: GPA below 3.0Too  many ¡°I¡± grades (Incompletes) or not finishing ¡°I¡¯s¡±Unsatisfactory  progressNot affiliated with an advisorNot meeting degree milestones   Advancing to Candidacy for the M.S. Degree Policy  Both M.S. and Ph.D. students must advance to candidacy for the M.S. degree  (not applicable to Ph.D. students who already hold an M.S. degree in Computer  Science). This implies that you are almost finished with the M.S. portion of  your degree. Students must file the advancement to M.S. candidacy form one  quarter prior to M.S degree conferral.  M.S. Thesis Option Policy  A thesis option is available to M.S. students who do not plan to take the  comprehensive exam and who are in good academic standing with the School.  Students pursuing this option must enroll in at least two quarters of Thesis  Supervision (CS 298 or INF 298) which will substitute for two required courses  as specified under the concentration area or specialization of choice (not available to students in the Statistics program).  A committee of three faculty members will guide the student and give final  approval of the thesis. The committee consists of an advisor (from the student's  department/program), who is willing to supervise the thesis project, and two  other faculty members (one of whom must be from the student's  department/program), who are willing to serve on the committee as readers. An  oral presentation of the thesis to the committee is required.   Teaching Requirement Policy  All Ph.D. students are required to participate in teaching activities for two  quarters. Summer teaching or teaching at another university may be accepted in  fulfillment of this requirement.  Students who fulfill this requirement with a teaching assistantship at UCI  are required to take an orientation course, ICS 398A, enroll in four units of  ICS 399 each quarter they serve as a TA, and attend the school's TA training  seminar during Welcome Week of fall quarter.  Students with a Previously Earned Master¡¯s Degree  Bren School Ph.D. students with an M.S. degree in computer science or a related field from another university may qualify to receive credit for some or all  required courses. Course equivalency will be determined by the Bren School  Associate Dean for Student Affairs following a written recommendation from the  student's advisor. Final approval will come from the UCI Graduate Division. Ph.D. students waived from the M.S. portion of their degree may not,  in future, request that they be granted an M.S. degree in Computer Science or a  closely related field from UC Irvine.  Be aware that advisors can require that students take additional courses when  appropriate.   Written Comprehensive Exam/Phase II Exam  Each student must pass a written comprehensive examination offered by the  student¡¯s department.  See specific degree requirements for more information as this exam may vary  by degree/concentration.  Students should speak to their advisor, research area representative or the ICS graduate counselors  regarding test dates, preparation, and reading lists. Faculty from the  particular research area develop the exam, so the content and structure may vary  from year to year.  The exam is graded on three levels: M.S. Pass, Ph.D. Pass, and Fail. Ph.D. students who receive an M.S. Pass can qualify for the M.S. degree, but  must re-take the exam and pass at the Ph.D. level to continue in the Ph.D.  program.  Students may re-take the exam once.  If a student would like to take the exam for a third time, s/he must petition  the Bren School Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Dean of Graduate  Division for permission.  If the petition is denied, the student may be dismissed from the program.   Once the exam is passed at the desired level, please make sure the  appropriate paperwork is filed with the Bren School graduate counselor.   Advancing to Candidacy for the Ph.D. degree  Prior to advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree, students must complete  the following steps:  1) Complete coursework2) Pass the Phase  II exam at the Ph.D. level (if applicable to the student's program) 3)  Complete a research or survey paper of publishable quality (if applicable to the student's program) The advancement exam is an oral presentation to a five-member committee of  senate faculty. Each committee member must agree on the research you would like  to complete for your doctoral dissertation.  Committee membership policies may vary by department/program. Consult the ICS  graduate counselors for more information.  Preparing for the Advancement Talk: ? Arrange a date  when all involved parties can meet? Reserve a conference room with your  department ? Print out or pick up a Ph.D. Form I from the  Bren School Graduate Office After the advancement exam is  complete: ? Get appropriate signatures on the Ph.D. Form I  (including your own!) - The ICS Graduate Office can provide the Department  Chair and Associate Dean signatures. ? Pay $90 advancement fee at the  Cashier's office ? Turn form into Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall)    Candidacy Committee Duties and Responsibilities  The candidacy committee is charged with determining the fitness of the  student to proceed with the doctoral dissertation through a formal candidacy examination.  The examination should evaluate both general preparedness in the discipline,  and specific competence to pursue the proposed dissertation topic.  In its deliberation, the committee ordinarily will review the student's  academic record, preliminary examinations, evaluations by other faculty, and may  conduct any other examination it thinks appropriate.  The candidacy committee will also review an outline of the proposed  dissertation project, and will determine by oral examination the student's  competence in that area.   When, by unanimous vote, the committee decides the student is qualified for  the dissertation phase, it should recommend advancement to candidacy to the  Graduate council via the Graduate Dean.   Following its formal appointment, the committee is free to adopt whatever  procedures it thinks appropriate to conduct the qualifying examination for  candidacy, subject to the rules of the program and those specified below.   Administration of the qualifying examination must conform to the policies  established by the Graduate Council.   The student must be given adequate notice of the content, form and time of  the examination. The committee must meet to decide upon the procedures to be  followed, and the student must be given an opportunity to comment upon the  selected procedures.   Before voting upon its recommendation for or against candidacy, the committee  as a whole shall meet with the student, and any member of the committee will  have the right to pose appropriate questions to the student.   If it decides to do so, the committee may conduct part of the examination on  an individual basis, e.g. the student may meet with each in turn. However, the committee must conclude its examination when convened with the student present.   Although the formal candidacy examination ordinarily is conducted in a single  day, the committee may meet intermittently over a longer period, and may decide  to reexamine the student on one or more topics after a specified interval.   When the committee meets to conduct the oral candidacy examination, it must  report to the Graduate Council via the Graduate Dean within 30 days.   If the committee decides to reexamine the student at a later date or does not  pass the student for any reason, this must be reported. The final vote and  recommendation of the committee must be unanimous and unequivocal.   Upon completion of the candidacy examination, the results should be submitted  to the UCI Graduate Division on the Report of the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee,  Ph.D. Form I.   Ph.D. Form I must be signed by all committee members at the time the  candidacy examination is concluded, and submitted even if the examination was  failed.   If the unanimous recommendation of the committee is favorable, the $90 advancement to candidacy fee must be paid by the student to the campus Cashier's  Office. This will validate the Ph.D. Form I, after which it should be submitted  to the UCI Graduate Division. The signed and validated Ph.D. Form I serves as  the application for advancement to candidacy.   The candidate and graduate counselor will be notified of formal advancement  and the appointment of a doctoral committee.   Topic Defense Policy  Once you determine your dissertation topic, you must present it in a defense  to your doctoral committee. Each area differs as to when students present this  defense, so please confirm with your advisor as to when you should be completing  this requirement.   At the time of your defense, you must bring a ¡°Topic Defense ¡± form for your  committee to sign after they have approved your defense. These forms are  available from the Bren School Graduate Office. The signed form is then returned  to the Bren School Graduate Office.   Final Defense Policy  For the final defense of your dissertation, e-mail the Bren School Graduate  Office with the date, time and location of the defense, the names of your committee  members, and the title and abstract of your dissertation. This information will  be made available to all Bren School faculty and graduate students. In  addition to your committee members, anyone else who wishes to attend your  defense may do so.   Also, be sure to obtain a Ph.D. Form II: Report on Final Examination for the  Ph.D. Degree, from the Bren School Graduate Office and, at the end of the  defense, have each of your committee members sign it.   When you have finished your dissertation, submit it and the Ph.D. Form II to  the UCI Library Archives (Langson Library, Room 525). Alternatively, the dissertation may be submitted electronically. The Library will notify the UCI Graduate Division that your dissertation has  been turned in and your degree is ready for conferral. Graduate Division will  notify you once your degree has been conferred.   Residency Requirement Policy  A minimum of six quarters (for PhD students) or three quarters (for MS  students) in academic residence is required prior to the award of the degree.  Typically, a longer period of study (two to six years) is required for  completion of all degree requirements.  After a Ph.D. student has been registered for over 21 quarters (seven years),  and a MS student has been registered for over six quarters (two years), they are  considered to be beyond normative time for completing the degree.  A letter regarding this status is sent to the student and to the department  requesting a deadline be implemented for the student to complete all  requirements and submit their dissertation. If this deadline is missed the  student is subject to academic disqualification.  University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment  Effective December 14, 2004, the Office of the President issued a revised  University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment and associated Procedures  for Responding to Reports of Sexual Harassment.  These policies cover all members of the University community, including  faculty and other academic personnel, staff employees, students, and non-student  or non-employee participants in University programs.  Revisions to the policy include an updated definition of sexual harassment,  clarification of the University's obligation to respond promptly and effectively  to reports of sexual harassment, provisions for training employees and educating  the University community regarding sexual harassment, and a statement that the  policy shall be implemented in a manner that recognizes principles of free  speech and academic freedom.   The Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity has developed local policy and  guidelines that implement the system wide procedures and address consensual  relationships.   These supersede the previous UCI Policy on Sexual Harassment:   Section  700-17: Guidelines for Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution   Section 700-16:  Policy on Conflicts of Interest Created by Consensual Relationships   The University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment can be found here.   All documents can be accessed through the Sexual Harassment Officer website  at www.sho.uci.edu   Bren School Copyright Infringement Policy  It is illegal to distribute copyrighted materials -- such as software,  movies, music, pictures -- without proper authorization.   If a complaint of copyright infringement is reported involving a computer  assigned to a Bren School student, the student's account will be locked out  until Bren School support personnel have a chance to investigate the  allegations. If copyrighted materials are found, they will be removed  immediately.   For the initial complaint (first violation), the Bren School Student Affairs  Office (SAO) staff and the appropriate Associate Dean (as well as the academic  advisor, for grad students) will be notified.   The student will be required to meet in person with appropriate SAO staff to  review applicable campus policies, and to sign a statement verifying receipt and  notice of such policies. This signed statement will be placed in the student's  file.   For any subsequent complaints, the appropriate Associate Dean, academic  advisor (for grad students) and SAO staff will be notified.   The student will then be referred to the campus Director of Student Judicial  Affairs for academic suspension (upon second violation) or expulsion from the  university(upon third violation).

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Undergraduate > Degrees      Undergraduate minor in Statistics     DEGREES AVAILABLE: Minor    The Department of Statistics offers lower-division undergraduate courses designed to introduce students to the field of statistics (Statistics 7, 8, 67) and upper-division undergraduate courses on the theoretical foundations of probability and statistics (Statistics 120A-B-C, 121) and statistical methodology (Statistics 110-111-112).  The Department is in the process of planning an undergraduate degree program in Statistics. In the interim, students interested in focusing on statistics are encouraged to consider a minor in Statistics along with a major in a field of interest.    ? Is the Statistics minor for me? 			    ? What do I take? 			    ? What can I do with this minor? 		      ? Still not sure?      Is the Statistics minor for me?  Statistics is  the field associated with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.  Statistical theory and methods are relevant in a wide range of fields in the social, physical, and biological sciences, as well as in a range of practical areas like public policy, education, engineering and medicine.   The minor in Statistics is designed to provide students with exposure to both statistical theory and practice. The minor requires a total of seven courses. These include a mathematics course, five core statistics courses, and an elective that may be taken from among several departments.  Some of the courses used to complete the minor may include prerequisites that may or may not be part of a student's course requirements for their major. Because of this the minor is somewhat intensive, but it is a useful complement to a variety of undergraduate fields for mathematically inclined students. The minor, supplemented with a few additional courses (mathematics and computing), would provide sufficient background for graduate study in statistics. Students considering a minor in Statistics should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Statistics as early as possible to plan their course work. NOTE: Students may not receive both a minor in Statistics and a specialization in Statistics within the Mathematics major. ¡ü Back to top  What do I take? SIX REQUIRED COURSES:               Mathematics 3A, Statistics 120A-B-C, Statistics 110-111. ONE ELECTIVE COURSE:                  Students select one course from the following list, or can substitute another with approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies:                                 Statistics 7 or equivalent course (but only if taken prior to Statistics 110); Statistics 112; Statistics 121; Mathematics 105A or 105B; Mathematics 130B or 130C; Mathematics 132B or 132C; ICS 21. There are two main routes by which students typically approach the statistics minor.  More mathematical students will frequently take Statistics 120A-B-C first and find the statistical theory intriguing enough to pursue the minor.   Other students will initially be exposed to statistics in an introductory course (Statistics 7, Statistics 8, Statistics 67 or its equivalent) and then may choose to learn more about methodology in Statistics 110-111 and theory in Statistics 120A-B-C.  ¡ü Back to top                   What can I do with this minor?  The Statistics minor will add a statistical perspective to a student's major field of study.  The statistical perspective emphasizes the important role that uncertainty and variation play in understanding the world around us.    A student's  enhanced quantitative reasoning skills will be useful in any future career path -- this includes study towards a professional degree (e.g., law or medicine), graduate study in  a field of interest, or a position in industry or government.  Students who complete the minor requirements will be able to:                			   			   recognize the important role of uncertainty and variability in                 empirical studies of real world phenomenonemploy basic statistical methods to analyze and explore dataunderstand the theoretical underpinnings of basic statistical methods ¡üBack to top Special Programs and Learning Opportunities  			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential  learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will  help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor,  or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other  campus programs and resources that support your interests and future  goals. 			   ? CONCENTRATIONS:  Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context    All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan  that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other  requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.  The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services  and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in  multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive  international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the  concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the  history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside  the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international  host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host  country.  Application: Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a  guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be  approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student  Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a  high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic  counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education  regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to  internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic  counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified  students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as  needed.

Informatics brings together software engineering, human-computer  interaction, and the study of information technology in organizations  into a single, focused degree program.				 Informatics addresses the design and construction of  information technology systems that will be effective in real-world  situations.  It includes not only building software but also examining  the human, organizational, and social context where the system will be  used.  Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design,  implementation, use, and impact of information technology. Informatics is a common term for computer science in  European universities; the number of Informatics programs in American  universities is growing. Traditional computer science programs focus on analyzing and  designing computers and computer systems, but the success of those  systems depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on  the real-world situations where they will be used¡ªthe human users and  their requirements, characteristics, and organizations. Informatics  studies computer systems in their real-world context and how to design  and build those systems so they work effectively in that context.  In Informatics we aim to: Design and develop new uses for information technology.Understand the effect information technology has on  people.Apply information technology in fields ranging from  medicine to music, from ecology to aerospace, from finance to  entertainment. ?

Special  Programs and Courses 		        ? Still  not sure?   	              Is Informatics for me?  Informatics is for you if you: Enjoy solving problems using all the tools you have available. Can work not only with technical details but also with  ¡°big-picture¡± issues Have strong reading and writing skills and can think freely,  creatively, and systematically. Previous experience in computer programming is not required to  start the Informatics major. Programming is just one aspect of  Informatics and the major introduces all the necessary skills at a  manageable pace. Students who do already have some programming  experience will also find new concepts, even in the very first course.  The Informatics major offers a contemporary curriculum with an  emphasis on group work (starting in the first course), studio-oriented  design courses, and a year-long senior project. The first year of the program provides students with a hands-on  introduction to the broad field of Informatics, centering on the  Informatics Core Course. This year-long course develops students¡¯ basic  understanding of software: how to design and construct programs and how  the programs operate as part of information technology systems. The second year builds up a portfolio of foundational concepts  and techniques that establish the discipline of Informatics; these  contribute to the ¡°toolbox¡± students will use in subsequent years to  solve large-scale information and software design problems.  As  sophomores, students begin to take more advanced courses that support  their specialization in either software engineering, human-computer  interaction, or the study of organizations and information technology.  These may involve courses in Management, Psychology, Computer Science,  or Engineering. In the third year, all students study the design process,  project management, and the impacts of technology on the real world.  Students continue to take electives in their specialized area of study. The fourth year is built around a year-long capstone project in  which groups of students address a significant project, typically from  an outside client. ¡ü Back  to top  What do I take?  All Informatics majors take a common core of 16  courses. After their first year, Informatics majors choose an additional  10 courses in one of three specializations: Software EngineeringHuman-Computer InteractionOrganizations and Information Technology REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INFORMATICS MAJOR  (effective Fall 2009) Lower-division: Introductory courses: Informatics 41, 42, 43, 44.ICS 23 or Informatics 45.ICS 6B/Mathematics 6B, Statistics 7/Mathematics 7 or  Statistics 67/Mathematics 67, and Philosophy 29.

Additional information about this degree can be found  on the Department of  Informatics web site.  ¡ü Back  to top                 What can I do with this degree?   A degree in Informatics provides excellent preparation for  work at the forefront of the computing industry.                               Our students work in many industrial settings, such  as start-up companies, small software houses, consulting firms and  multi-national corporations.                               They are prepared for careers including these: Software EngineerHuman-Computer Interface DesignerInformation ArchitectGame DesignerUsability EngineerMobile Computing Systems Designer Many students will go on to graduate school in computer  engineering, computer science, information science, management or law. ¡üBack to top  What can I do with the Informatics Minor? The minor provides a focused study of Informatics to  supplement a student¡¯s major program of study and prepares students for a  profession, career, or academic pursuit in which information and  software design is an integral part but is not the primary focus.  The minor allows students sufficient flexibility to  pursue courses that complement their major field or address specific  interests. The minor particularly centers on understanding the  relationships among computers and people, and how these relationships  must be addressed in information and software design.  REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INFORMATICS MINOR* Lower Division:               Informatics 41, 42, 43, and 44  Upper Division:               Informatics 111 and 131; and at least one of the following  pairs of courses: Informatics 101 and Informatics 102, Informatics 113  and 115, Informatics 151 and 153, Informatics 161 and 162, Informatics  132 and 143, CS 122A and CS 122B. Before enrolling in any course for the Informatics  minor, students should ensure that they meet its prerequisites. See the  course prerequisites listed in the Catalogue or on the Informatics  Web site. NOTE: A maximum of two courses can be  taken Pass/Not Pass to satisfy the minor in Informatics. Students  majoring in Information and Computer Science, Computer Science, or  Computer Science and Engineering cannot minor in Informatics. Students  who are considering a major in Informatics must complete the Informatics  courses with a letter grade.  *A proposed change to the Informatics Minor  requirements is expected to receive final campus approval in Fall  quarter, 2009.  If approved, the updated requirements will take effect  in Winter quarter, 2010.  Be sure to schedule an appointment with a  counselor to determine possible options available to you for completion  of the minor requirements.  ¡ü Back  to top 			   			                                  Special Programs and Learning Opportunities  			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential  learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will  help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor,  or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other  campus programs and resources that support your interests and future  goals. 			   ? CONCENTRATIONS:  Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context    All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan  that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other  requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.  The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services  and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in  multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive  international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the  concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the  history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside  the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international  host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host  country.  Application: Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a  guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be  approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student  Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a  high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic  counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education  regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to  internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic  counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified  students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as  needed.  Requirements:  A  minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an  emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary),  history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international  portion of the program, international law, international labor policy,  global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and  global economics; A  one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major  and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an  international university;A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.  ? MINORS  Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue  a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student  well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or  discipline.  Note:  Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the  student¡¯s major requirements.  Some major/minor combinations are not  allowed.  Biomedical Computing (10 courses)Digital Information Systems (7 courses)Informatics (8 courses)Information and Computer Science (7 courses)Statistics (7 courses) ?

By definition, a mentor is an advisor who may provide academic or             career guidance, networking opportunities, and insights into the             working world. Students network with alumni to explore career                 interests and engage in mutually beneficial, professionally oriented                 relationships.  Similar career goals, shared interests or common academic                 backgrounds provide the foundation for the mentor/student relationship.  BENEFITS OF MENTORING                            While the advantages of a mentor program to our undergraduate students         may be more obvious, alumni also benefit from the program by: ? Enriching           their lives by making a difference in someone else's           ? Reconnecting           with the Bren School on a personal level     ? Gaining new skills as they advise and counsel students Sign up today to make a  difference in a student's life! Additional information about the program can be found in the  Mentor Handbook. There are also a series of mentoring tips to help you establish a successful and rewarding mentoring relationship.      More community ?

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Undergraduate > Degrees      Undergraduate degree in Information and Computer Science     DEGREES AVAILABLE: Major and Minor   		       The overall field of information and computer science spans a vast spectrum of topics.               		       At one end, it includes computer system design and networking, detailing how modern computer hardware and networks operate on a day-to-day basis.                		       At the other end are human factors, such as how software should be structured to facilitate cooperative work among groups of people.                		       The B.S. in Information and Computer Science (ICS) provides students with a broad introduction to these topics.                		       In the lower division, ICS students prepare with fundamental courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by breadth courses from other disciplines.                		       In the upper division, they take courses that ensure all majors are exposed to the basic principles of programming languages, compilers, operating systems, digital logic, computer architecture, algorithms and data structures, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.               		       To complete their major requirements, students complement these basic introductions by choosing from a diverse set of auxiliary courses, including advanced courses exploring the above topics in more depth and courses covering such topics as computer game development, computer graphics, and expert systems.               		       By selecting appropriate elective courses, students may choose to complete the requirements for a specialization in one or more of six areas: Artificial IntelligenceComputer SystemsImplementation and Analysis of AlgorithmsInformation SystemsNetworks and Distributed SystemsSoftware Systems   ? Is Information and Computer Science for me? 			    ? What do I take? 			    ? What can I do with this degree? 			    ? Special Programs and Learning Opportunities 			    ? Still not sure?      Is Information and Computer Science for me? By choosing one or more of the above specializations, ICS students will augment their education.                               The choice to pursue a specialization usually occurs in the junior year, after students have gained experience with the range of possible areas in the overall field of information and computer science.                               ICS can be a good choice of major for you if you are interested in any of the following areas:                              Artificial Intelligence               Prepares students in both the theory and implementation of AI methods, such as expert systems, neural nets, reasoning, constraint satisfaction and machine learning.

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Community > News > Press releases      Press release      January 17,  2013UCI app safely stores DNA on smartphones    Gene Tsudik       Irvine, Calif., Jan. 17, 2013 ¡ª UC Irvine computer scientists have created an app that could allow an individual to securely store and use his or her own DNA on a smartphone. GenoDroid, they said, could potentially be used for paternity and common-ancestry tests, customized cancer-fighting drugs and more.   ¡°Imagine you¡¯re on a first date,¡± said Gene Tsudik, professor of computer science. ¡°You and the other person could hold up your phones, exchange tiny amounts of information and be able to tell what your children would look like. Or, more seriously, you might be able to estimate their odds of being born with something like Down syndrome.¡±   Tested on an Android platform, the app determined in less than half a second whether one person was another¡¯s father. Because of advanced encryption techniques that build on the team¡¯s earlier work, Tsudik said, only a small piece of each person¡¯s DNA was needed, while the rest remained secure.   ¡°A virtual treasure trove of frighteningly personal and sensitive information is contained in one¡¯s genome,¡± he and fellow authors wrote in a recent paper for the Association for Computing Machinery. ¡°Our protocols only yield the test results and do not disclose individuals¡¯ genomic information.¡±   Tsudik said: ¡°Maintaining the privacy of your DNA is crucial. Imagine the potential consequences if it were to leak out. For example, you could be denied health or life insurance. When your bank account or your credit card is compromised, it¡¯s painful, but it¡¯s recoverable. You can close the account, wipe the slate clean and start over. You cannot change your DNA once it¡¯s leaked.¡±   GenoDroid builds on the increasing availability of genome sequencing. Services like 23andme now let consumers send in a cheek swab and receive their own genome in the mail. While DNA digitization can cost hundreds of dollars today, prices are dropping fast. Once people have the information in electronic form, they¡¯ll be able to load it onto their smartphones, and GenoDroid could encrypt it. The UC Irvine team will release the next version of the app when such digitalization becomes commonplace.   Having their genome on a mobile device could enable individuals to learn quickly and cheaply whether they¡¯re genetically predisposed to major health conditions such as Huntington¡¯s disease, certain mental illnesses or additional risks.   GenoDroid also holds promise in the rapidly growing area of personalized medicine. Pharmaceutical companies already produce highly customized drugs for specific cancers and other illnesses based on a patient¡¯s DNA markers. However, some consumers fear losing insurance coverage if their results are shared, Tsudik noted, and companies don¡¯t want to reveal proprietary information about treatments. The electronic ¡°double-blind¡± nature of GenoDroid offers a solution: Each side performs operations over encrypted versions of the other¡¯s data and learns only the outcome ¨C for instance, match or no match ¨C and nothing more.   The GenoDroid team also included Emiliano De Cristofaro, who earned his doctorate at UC Irvine and is now with Xerox¡¯s Palo Alto Research Center; Ph.D. student Sky Faber; and Paolo Gasti, a former UC Irvine postdoctoral researcher who¡¯s now with New York Institute of Technology.   About the University of California, Irvine: Founded in 1965, UCI is a top-ranked university dedicated to research, scholarship and community service.

Degree Available:  Major 			   		        The Computer Game Science (CGS) major combines a solid foundation in computer  science with a focus on designing, building, and understanding computer games and other forms of interactive media. The fundamentals of information and  computer science ¡ª along with coursework in mathematics, statistics, physics,  and film and media studies ¡ª provide students with the concepts and tools to  study a wide scope of computer game technologies.    CGS emphasizes design, teamwork, and the understanding  of computer games and related technologies and media in a social and cultural  context. The term ¡°computer game¡± includes games that run on cell phones,  mobile devices, PCs, consoles, Macs, web pages and even inside automobiles.  CGS majors design and create games for entertainment, and also for education,  training and social change.   The study of computer games is an emerging field driven by advancing computer  hardware and software technology, the widespread popularity of video games as  an entertainment medium, and by the interest of artists, economists,  educators, scientists and many others to use game technologies for  communication, visualization, computation and learning.   Is Computer Game Science for me?   CGS is ideal for anyone interested in learning the technical components of creating games ¡ª computer programming, graphics, network design, database management, artificial intelligence and much more ¡ª and working in teams to design and implement exciting new games. If you are primarily interested in the art or management sides of creating games, the CGS major may not be the best fit for you.   Students who major in Computer Game Science will:  acquire a solid foundation in computer science and software development;       learn how to create interactive and human-centered computer game designs;       employ an interdisciplinary approach to computer game design and development,           drawing on coursework in modeling and design, graphics, software engineering,           hardware architectures, AI, algorithms, distributed systems, human interfaces           and aesthetics;       be able to analyze and discuss computer game systems as communication,           teaching and entertainment media that can be a force for education, social           change and activism;       graduate with an extensive portfolio of implemented games.     ¡üBack to top Why study at UC Irvine?   Several factors contribute to the strength of UC Irvine¡¯s Computer Game Science program, including:     Overall excellence. Ranked 28th nationally by U.S.           News and World Report, computer science education at UCI is broad,           deep and cutting-edge.       Location. Irvine and Orange County are home to a           remarkable concentration of game development studios large and small,           including industry giant Blizzard Entertainment. We consulted with           these companies (many of which employ or were founded by UCI alumni)           while planning the CGS major, and they look forward to offering           internships and jobs to our students.       Collaboration. We partner with nearby           Laguna College of Art and Design,           which offers a Game Art major. Their student artists work with our           CGS students to develop innovative, visually engaging games.     ¡üBack to top What courses do I take?

A wide variety of careers and graduate programs are open to Computer Game Science graduates. The video game industry is comparable in size to the film and music industries, and job growth projections are excellent for people with strong technical backgrounds. Many other fields, including mobile software development, interactive entertainment, and training and education software, have demand for similar skill sets and knowledge. CGS graduates are well trained in computer science, and can thus pursue graduate programs or any career that involves designing, implementing, evaluating or interacting with computer-based systems.   ¡üBack to top Special Programs and Learning Opportunities  			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential  learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will  help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor,  or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other  campus programs and resources that support your interests and future  goals. 			   ? CONCENTRATIONS:  Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context    All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan  that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other  requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.  The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services  and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in  multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive  international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the  concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the  history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside  the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international  host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host  country.  Application: Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a  guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be  approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student  Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a  high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic  counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education  regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to  internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic  counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified  students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as  needed.  Requirements:  A  minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an  emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary),  history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international  portion of the program, international law, international labor policy,  global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and  global economics; A  one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major  and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an  international university;A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.  ? MINORS  Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue  a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student  well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or  discipline.  Note:  Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the  student¡¯s major requirements.  Some major/minor combinations are not  allowed.  Biomedical Computing (10 courses)Digital Information Systems (7 courses)Informatics (8 courses)Information and Computer Science (7 courses)Statistics (7 courses) ? OPPORTUNITIES FOR HONORS-LEVEL STUDY Students who are majoring in Biomedical Computing, Business Information  Management, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, and  Information and Computer Science, and ICS Undeclared Pre-Majors are  invited to apply for admission to the Bren School of ICS's introductory  honors sequence (ICS H21/H22/H23).  These courses provide a uniquely  challenging and intimate learning environment in which conventional  course material is explored in greater depth.       A student must meet at least one of the following criteria to be eligible to enroll in ICS H21:   Minimum 620 on each of 2 of 3 sections of the SAT; orMember of the UCI Campuswide Honors Program; orVerification of score of 3 or higher on AP Computer Science A exam; or  Eligible students will be provided an authorization code (required) for  course enrollment at the time of their summer orientation/registration  session. ? BREN SCHOOL OF ICS HONORS PROGRAM                                  Allows juniors and seniors majoring in Computer Science,  Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, or Information and  Computer Science to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. Students admitted to the program participate in an honors seminar,  conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, and  write a research paper.  More information about eligibility criteria and benefits of successful completion of the honors program is available at the Honors program web site.  ? INDEPENDENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES                                 The School encourages all majors to take advantage of this  valuable experience, and faculty advertise many research opportunities  every year.  Students are also encouraged to participate in the campus Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP),  which offers guidance and grant funding for student-proposed  independent research, and sponsors programs which provide summer  stipends for students working on faculty-guided research. ? CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM                                 Available to selected high-achieving students from all  academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more  information see the CHP web site.  ? EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM                                Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience  different cultures while making progress toward degree objectives  through the Education Abroad Program (EAP).  EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world.  ?

This very popular and successful program also serves as a cost effective recruitment tool for highly qualified IT professionals.   How it works:  Participating companies submit criteria for desired internship. They then receive background information on Bren School students who have expressed interest in company internships.     Companies rank the students whose credentials best match their employment needs, while students rank the sponsoring companies in a similar fashion.      Bren School personnel review these two sets of rankings and make matches that best reflect the interests and needs of both parties.      Companies interview the candidate/s and, should the match be mutually agreeable, offer a paid internship during the summer and/or academic year, as well pay for the student¡¯s fees.     The financial terms of the internship are negotiated directly between the student and the sponsoring company.  Students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.8 (undergraduate) and 3.3 (graduate) during their involvement in the sponsored internship program.   How to participate:  In order to participate in this program, each company pays a tax-deductible donation to the Bren School, which covers the cost of the student¡¯s annual fees.  Undergraduate Resident Fees donation:  $15,500*    Graduate Resident Fees donation:  $16,500*  *Amounts may vary based on fee increases and/or if the desired student is a non-resident. ?

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Undergraduate > Student resources      Special programs     There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential  learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will  help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor,  or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other  campus programs and resources that support your interests and future  goals. 			   ?  CONCENTRATIONS: Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context    All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan  that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other  requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.  The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services  and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in  multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive  international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the  concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the  history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside  the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international  host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host  country.  Application: Each student¡¯s proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a  guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be  approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student  Affairs.  It is expected that each student¡¯s proposal will reflect a  high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic  counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education  regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to  internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic  counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified  students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as  needed.  Requirements:  A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus  with an emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary),  history, literature of the country that corresponds to the  international portion of the program, international law, international  labor policy, global issues, global institutions, global conflict and  negotiation and global economics; A one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to  the major and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken  at an international university;A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same  country as the international educational experience. ? MINORS  Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue  a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student  well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or  discipline.

Mr. Bren's gift equals the largest single gift ever to UC Irvine and has  created the most endowed faculty positions at one time on any University of  California campus. In recognition of this transformational gift, the school, renowned worldwide  for leading the innovation of new information and computing technologies and  producing an educated work force to fuel the economic engine, will be renamed  the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine. This historic gift accelerates the school's plans for achieving its  overarching goal of becoming a top ten computer science program within five  years.  In conjunction with the June 9, 2004, naming announcement, the Donald Bren  School of Information and Computer Sciences also will break ground on its new  home, Bren Hall, expected to be completed in late 2006. Competitively positioned among other top-ranked schools, this gift allows the  school of information and computer sciences to continue in its upward trajectory  of recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest students, faculty and  researchers.  The school of information and computer sciences has long been a program that  combines vision and determination with wisdom. Those attributes, in concert with  Mr. Bren¡¯s support, will continue to allow its students, alumni and faculty to  impact the world. Elevated to school status in December 2002, the nationally acclaimed school  is the first independent computer science school within the UC system and one of  the fastest-growing programs of its kind in the nation.

? INF231 Term projects ?  Project 1: General evaluation of the user interface of the online catalog ANTPAC in terms of understandabiliy and usability. What needs to be changed and how?  Note: De-emphasize the issues that are being studied in projects 2 and 3 Make sure to study whether users understand the tabs for navigation   Team 1: Gary Suh, Pornpat Nikamanon, Satyajit Das, Meng-Pin Yang Team 2: Jahnavi Kondragunta, Vesna Memisevic, Jae Young Lee, Rosalva Gallardo   Project 2: How could we make ANTPAC's "advanced search" page easier to understand and use?  Note: the "advanced search" is the search functionality that is accessible through the "Advanced Keyword" tab. Team 3: Byeong Sam, Marvin Park, Kang-chen ?   Project 3: Are the results pages of ANTPAC clear and easy to understand? How should it be changed?  Specific concerns:  Do users like to be taken first to the very brief record (title, location, circulation status) rather than the full bibliographic record?Do they like the feature that includes a link called "website" that leads them to a table of contents page? Do they understand the results page they get when they click on the call number link? When they click on "Full Record" in the results screen, do they expect to see more information than is presented?Do users understand how to save and export (i.e. email usually) bibliographic records to themselves?  Team 4: Nicolas Mangano, Lorraine Kan, Tempe Kraus, Joel Ossher  Project 4: Observe carefully users' interaction in the Online Resources Locator. Are design changes needed?  Note: use the tasks below, among others. Find the Los Angeles Times in electronic full-textHow many databases does UCI have that contain aricles on ethnic studies?Find the electronic version of the Journal of Contemporary History.How many journals does UCI Libraries subscribe to about African literature and languages?How many online French dictionaries does the Libraries have? How many are open to the public?Does UCI Libraries subscribe to any newspapers about agriculture?Find the following article: Kobsa, A. and Fink, J. "An LDAP-based User Modeling Server and its Evaluation." User Modeling and User Adapted Interaction 16:2 (May 2006) pp. 129-169  ?Team 5: Alegria Baquero, Kah Liu, Ruy Cervantes, Mohamad Monibi  Project 5: Study the useability of the Special Collections & Archives. Are design changes needed?  Specific concerns:  General evaluation of the user interface in terms of understandability and usabilityDo students understand where they are in relation to the main UCI Libraries page?How usable is the overall interface?How usable is the main navigation and subnavigation?      Team 6: Nobu Takeo, Rose Roberts, and Hui-Chun Lin Team 7: Tanmay Goel, Ritesh Subramanian, Joel Ross   Project 6: Are the results from a search in UCSF "QuickSearch" confusing to users? How should the site be changed?  Specific concerns: Are the types of data being searched via the simple search box clear?Do students understand the diversity of resources they get?Do users expect to get results from *inside* the databases and journals or do they realize that they are getting hits on titles only?Are they frustrated that clicking on a journal title takes them only an interface at which they have to repeat the search to find full-text?Do they understand the different types of navigation required inside an online catalog as compared to a publisher's website or a webpage that describes "special collections"?

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Community > Events >       Butterworth Product Development Competition            Goal of the Butterworth Competition The goal of the Butterworth Product Development Competition is to create a culture within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at UC Irvine that encourages an entrepreneurial spirit among students and encourages the development of new, technically innovative products by graduate and undergraduate students. For those ICS students who are interested in creating products and starting businesses, this will provide an opportunity to meet other students on campus with these same interests, and to interact with faculty and mentors who can advise them. To participate or for more information, please contact Kristin Huerth at khuerth@ics.uci.edu.  ? Background Paul Butterworth is co-founder and chief technical officer of AmberPoint, Inc. (recently sold to Oracle Corp.), a leading provider of management software for service-oriented architectures. ?Before AmberPoint, Paul was a founder of Forte Software where he served as the chief architect and senior vice president of engineering and customer services.? He later became chief technology officer for Forte Tools at Sun Microsystems. Before founding Forte, he served as chief architect and director of product engineering at Ingres Corporation. A resident of Alamo, Calif., Butterworth was named in 2002 one of Red Herring¡¯s ¡°Top Innovators,¡± a distinction which honors innovative executives whose pioneering spirit lead to breakthrough contributions for their companies and the information industry. He attended UC Irvine where he received his B.S. in ICS in 1974 and his M.S. in 1981. ? Program Rules and Guidelines ? Product Development. The Butterworth Competition is designed to encourage the creation of innovative products based on information and computing technologies. Each team will submit a concept paper and business product plan (described below) during the course of the competition.?? Products are evaluated on their technological merits and potential to impact the marketplace. Students are encouraged to submit new products that involve the development of software and systems. Products that entail integration of subsystems are acceptable as long as there is a substantial innovative component. ? Participants. The competition is open to all UCI students. Teams must be composed of at least two students, of which at least one must be an ICS student. For example, a team member from the Merage School of Business could contribute business planning knowledge that would help the team or students from schools of science or engineering could contribute knowledge of a particular application or technology. Students can be graduate or undergraduate, but must be registered at UC Irvine for the duration of the academic year of the competition. We encourage teams to have at least one student who has taken (or is concurrently enrolled in the Entrepreneurship in the Information Age course (COMPSCI 190/COMPSCI 295).? This course will help students think in terms of products and evaluating their product ideas from a commercial perspective.? The competition welcomes groups of students engaged in ICS project courses (in either Computer Science or Informatics).?  ? Mentors. At the start of the competition, each team is paired with at least one mentor if they have not already selected one. Mentors are composed of local industry engineers and executives, ICS faculty, and experienced entrepreneurs. Mentors are chosen based on the mentor¡¯s expertise and the team¡¯s product idea.  ? Timeline. The competition is officially kicked off during winter quarter and runs through the end of spring quarter. There is a required final demonstration at the close of the competition. ? Prizes.? Final awards will be presented during the Butterworth Competition showcase at the end of the academic year. There will be cash awards for the top three teams.  ? Guidelines  To participate in the competition, teams must fill out the Web-based   intent-to-enter form  indicating participation interest (available after the official kickoff during winter quarter). Upon completion of this form, teams will be assigned industry/faculty mentors according to the criteria delineated in the registration form. ? Obtaining Additional Team Members: Potential participants are encouraged to meet students with similar interests who may be willing to collaborate and form a team at one of the info sessions offered prior to the intent-to-enter deadline. Students from across campus are encouraged to attend even if they do not have a concept developed. ? Requirements: Teams will be required to present a concept paper, product specification, and a final product and business plan (deadlines noted above).? The business product portion should include evidence that a market exists for the product with preliminary plans for a product price and market size.? Additional details regarding the required documents will be provided at the kickoff event.? All documents should be single spaced with a font size between 10 and 12 points. ? Demonstrations: Demonstrations of the product are required for the final phase of the competition.? Teams will have a chance to present their projects and demos in front of a panel of judges.  ? Team Integrity: Once the concept paper has been submitted, 50% of the team must remain intact for the rest of the competition. 100% of the team must remain intact after submitting the product specification. ? No outside funding: Teams must present an original idea and be in a "pre-incubator" form. They must not be backed by incubators, existing companies, venture capitalists or other investors. Teams or team members that have received any form of venture capital financing for their competition entry plan or a likeness thereof may not participate in the competition. Any team receiving venture capital funding while participating in the competition will be disqualified. ? Judging Guidelines: ?The judges are professionals who come from various backgrounds. Judges are experts in the process of starting a business or in the technologies the students are developing. The judges consider many different criteria when evaluating concept papers, business product plans, and products. Some of the elements that are considered are as follows: ? - Does the technological/design innovation provide a sustainable, competitive advantage? - Does a competitive advantage exist over other products in this application? - Does the functionality satisfy the application? - Is the product description clear and detailed? - Is there a market need for this product? - Are the benefits to the user clear and sufficient to result in purchase? - Are the requirements thorough, realistic and accurate? - Is there a clear product architecture consistent with the current and evolving trends? ? ? ?

Butterworth Competition                                              Bren school home > Get involved      Sponsored Internship Program       What it is:  The Sponsored Internship Program offers companies a unique opportunity to enhance their workforce by hand-selecting undergraduate seniors or graduate-level students from the Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences to complete internships at their companies.  This very popular and successful program also serves as a cost effective recruitment tool for highly qualified IT professionals.   How it works:  Participating companies submit criteria for desired internship. They then receive background information on Bren School students who have expressed interest in company internships.     Companies rank the students whose credentials best match their employment needs, while students rank the sponsoring companies in a similar fashion.      Bren School personnel review these two sets of rankings and make matches that best reflect the interests and needs of both parties.      Companies interview the candidate/s and, should the match be mutually agreeable, offer a paid internship during the summer and/or academic year, as well pay for the student¡¯s fees.     The financial terms of the internship are negotiated directly between the student and the sponsoring company.  Students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.8 (undergraduate) and 3.3 (graduate) during their involvement in the sponsored internship program.   How to participate:  In order to participate in this program, each company pays a tax-deductible donation to the Bren School, which covers the cost of the student¡¯s annual fees.  Undergraduate Resident Fees donation:  $15,500*    Graduate Resident Fees donation:  $16,500*  *Amounts may vary based on fee increases and/or if the desired student is a non-resident. ?

If you are interested in adding a minor outside of the Bren School, check with the School that is offering the minor.  Most academic units do not require you to declare a minor. However, you may be asked to fill out an "Intent to Pursue the Minor" form which allows the academic unit to plan for course offerings for non-majors but in no way obligates you to finish the minor. Some schools, such as the Paul Merage School of Management (management and accounting minors), and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (digital arts minor), may limit the number of students that are accepted into their minor degree programs, or may require that you make academic progress within a certain timeframe.    Where do I find information on graduate schools?  The UCI Career Center offers a range of services regarding graduate school research, preparation and application (including an on-line Letter of Recommendation service).?  The Career Center also has a library of resource materials that are helpful for graduate school research (e.g. the Peterson¡¯s Guide to Graduate Programs (www.petersons.com), program brochures, and campus catalogues.  Find out more at the Career Center web site.?  After reading about the Bren School's graduate degree programs, you may also talk to one of the Bren School's graduate counselors to learn more about your academic preparedness and suitability for graduate work.Bren ICS graduate counselors hold drop-in hours Monday ¨C Friday, 1-3:30 pm; their offices are located in ICS 1, Suite 352.    Degree and Course Planning   How do I get into the Bren School of ICS Honors Program?  The Bren School Honors Program provides an opportunity for selected students in any one of the Bren School majors to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas in the School.  Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the School in the spring. Applications are available each year beginning May 1 and should be submitted by June 1 to ensure consideration. Students are notified during August and September since spring and summer (if applicable) grades are considered. Major-specific courses and GPA requirements are listed at the Bren School Honors Opportunities Program page. In selecting students for the honors program, the School also considers evidence of ability and interest in research.  Students admitted to the program participate in the Bren School Honors Seminar (ICS H197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the School, followed by a minimum of two quarters of independent supervised research (CS H198 or Informatics H198). Passing two H198s counts for one of the project courses required for the ICS and CS majors, provided that at least one of the remaining two project courses is taken in a different area.  In order for the student to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be written up as a final report and certified to be of honors quality by the student¡¯s faculty advisor and the Honors Program advisor.    What is a degree check and how do I request one?  A degree check is an evaluation of your progress towards your degree ¨C what requirements you have fulfilled and which you still must complete.  It includes an evaluation of all of your records ¨C AP credits, UCI work, courses taken at other colleges and universities.  All students should schedule a degree check at least once per year. Seniors must meet with a Bren School academic counselor to get a degree check at least 1-2 quarters before their intended graduation date (example, if you are aiming to graduate at the end of spring quarter, you must schedule a Degree Check during fall or winter quarter).?
